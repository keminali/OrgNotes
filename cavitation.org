** cavitation number
- \sigma :[[http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25021/1/chap5.pdf][cavitation number]]
it is conventional to characterize how close the pressure 
in the liquid flow is to the vapor pressure 
(and therefore the potential for cavitation) by means of the cavitation number
\[
\sigma = \frac{p_\infty - p_V (T_\infty)}{0.5 \rho_L U_\infty^2}
\]
 cavitation number expresses the relationship 
between the difference of a /local absolute pressure/ from /the vapor pressure/ and /the kinetic energy per volume/,
 and is used to characterize the potential of the flow to cavitate
