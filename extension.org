* Chapter outline

1. Introduction
	a. Background and motivation
	b. Research questions
	c. Objectives
	d. Accomplishments
	e. Structure of the thesis
2. Literature review
[You can put here reviews on marine power, marine turbines, blade hydro-aerodynamics]

3. Computational hydrodynamic methodology
	a Rapid solvers for the the horizontal axis marine turbine (HAMT) rotor in free space
		1) The steady BEM method
		2) The unsteady BEM method
	b  CFD 
		1) Turbulent flow simulation brief review[only brief review on DNS, LES and DES, as you have not used them in the project]
		2) Turbulent flow modelling
			a) RANS and URANS
			b) The global rotating grid and local sliding grid approaches
                                 [The global rotating grid is good for free space problems involving only the rotor and the sliding grid is more general and good for simulating the rotor+pylon and in confined space as including free surface waves and sea floor,
                                   but requires more computational resources]
