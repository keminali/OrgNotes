> sqrt(2*Turbulence Kinetic Energy /3)/Velocity in Stn Frame
sqrt(2TKE/3)=UI
- U: mean velocity
- I : turbulence intensity
- TKE: turbulence kinetic energy

to define a custom expression for the dynamics head, 0.5 \rho v^2
(a)   On the tab bar at the top of the workspace area, select ~Expressions~. Right-click in the Expressions area and select New.

(b)   In the New Expression dialog box, type: DynamicHeadExp

(c)   Click OK.

(d)   In the ~Definition~ area, type in this definition:

> Density * abs(Velocity)^2 / 2

 where:

    Density is a variable

    abs is a CEL function ( abs is unnecessary in this example, it simply illustrates the use of a CEL function)

    Velocity is a variable

   You can learn which predefined functions, variables, expression, locations, and constants are available by right-clicking in the Definition area.

(e)   Click Apply. 

2.   Associate the *expression* with a *variable* (as the plane you define in the next step can display only variables):

(a)   On the tab bar at the top of the workspace area, select Variables. Right-click in the Variables area and select New.

(b)   In the New Variable dialog box, type: DynamicHeadVar

(c)   Click OK.

(d)   In the Details view for DynamicHeadVar, click the drop-down arrow beside Expression and choose DynamicHeadExp. Click Apply.
