The main deficiency of the Smagorinsky model is that its eddy-viscosity does not go to zero for
laminar shear flows (only dU/dy != 0 ). For this reason, this model also requires a near-wall
damping function in the viscous sublayer. It is desirable to have a LES formulation that

* Implementing Web Scraping in Python with BeautifulSoup

There are mainly two ways to extract data from a website:

    Use the API of the website (if it exists). For example, Facebook has the Facebook Graph API which allows retrieval of data posted on Facebook.
    Access the HTML of the webpage and extract useful information/data from it. This technique is called web scraping or web harvesting or web data extraction.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-web-scraping-python-beautiful-soup/

* TODO web crawler -- python自动抓取网页中的pdf文件 

software: 
- [[https://scrapy.org/][scrapy]] -- framework for extracting the data from websites





#+begin_src python
# imported the requests library 
import requests 

# URL of the image to be downloaded is defined as image_url 
image_url = "https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png"

# send a HTTP request to the server and save  the HTTP response in a response object called r 
r = requests.get(image_url) # create HTTP response object 



with open("python_logo.png",'wb') as f: 
   f.write(r.content) 
	# Saving received content as a png file in binary format 

	# write the contents of the response (r.content) to a new file in binary mode. 
	
#+end_src 
This small piece of code written above will download the following image from the web. Now check your local directory(the folder where this script resides), and you will find this image:

All we need is the URL of the image source. (You can get the URL of image source by right-clicking on the image and selecting the View Image option.)

*Download large files:*

The HTTP response content (r.content) is nothing but a string which is storing the file data. So, it won’t be possible to save all the data in a single string in case of large files. To overcome this problem, we do some changes to our program:
Since all file data can’t be stored by a single string, we use =r.iter_content= method to load data in chunks, specifying the chunk size.
#+begin_src 
 r = requests.get(URL, stream = True)
#+end_src 
Setting stream parameter to True will cause the download of response headers only and the connection remains open. This avoids reading the content all at once into memory for large responses. A fixed chunk will be loaded each time while r.iter_content is iterated.

Here is an example:
#+begin_src 
import requests 
file_url = "http://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/db-book/db4/slide-dir/ch1-2.pdf"

r = requests.get(file_url, stream = True) 

with open("python.pdf","wb") as pdf: 
	for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=1024): 

		# writing one chunk at a time to pdf file 
		if chunk: 
			pdf.write(chunk) 
#+end_src 





*Downloading Videos*
In this example, we are interested in downloading all the video lectures available on [[http://www.py4inf.com/][this web-page]]. 
All the archives of this lecture are available [[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csev/books/py4inf/media/][here]].
 So, we first scrape the webpage to extract all video links and then download the videos one by one.

#+begin_src 
import requests 
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 

''' 
URL of the archive web-page which provides link to 
all video lectures. It would have been tiring to 
download each video manually. 
In this example, we first crawl the webpage to extract 
all the links and then download videos. 
'''

# specify the URL of the archive here 
archive_url = "http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csev/books/py4inf/media/"

def get_video_links(): 
	
	# create response object 
	r = requests.get(archive_url) 
	
	# create beautiful-soup object 
	soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content,'html5lib') 
	
	# find all links on web-page 
	links = soup.findAll('a') 

	# filter the link sending with .mp4 
	video_links = [archive_url + link['href'] for link in links if link['href'].endswith('mp4')] 

	return video_links 


def download_video_series(video_links): 

	for link in video_links: 

		'''iterate through all links in video_links 
		and download them one by one'''
		
		# obtain filename by splitting url and getting 
		# last string 
		file_name = link.split('/')[-1] 

		print "Downloading file:%s"%file_name 
		
		# create response object 
		r = requests.get(link, stream = True) 
		
		# download started 
		with open(file_name, 'wb') as f: 
			for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size = 1024*1024): 
				if chunk: 
					f.write(chunk) 
		
		print "%s downloaded!\n"%file_name 

	print "All videos downloaded!"
	return


if __name__ == "__main__": 

	# getting all video links 
	video_links = get_video_links() 

	# download all videos

Advantages of using =Requests= library to download web files are:

-    One can easily download the web directories by iterating recursively through the website!

-    This is a browser-independent method and much faster!

-   One can simply scrape a web page to get all the file URLs on a webpage and hence, download all files in a single command-

download and save a file is to use the =urllib.request.urlretrieve= function:

# Download the file from `url` and save it locally under `file_name`:
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, file_name)

import urllib.request

# Download the file from `url`, save it in a temporary directory and get the
# path to it (e.g. '/tmp/tmpb48zma.txt') in the `file_name` variable:
file_name, headers = urllib.request.urlretrieve(url)
#+end_src

Dear Editor of AJPS,
I am submitting a manuscript for consideration of publication in Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The manuscript is entitled “Preparation of nimodipine microspheres contained in a solid dispersion and evaluation of their in vitro and in vivo characteristics”.
  It has not been published elsewhere and that it has not been submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere.
Nimodipine was formulated into immediate and sustained release microspheres in a solid dispersion. Two types of microspheres i.e. immediate release and sustained release microspheres could be successfully prepared through adjustment of the ratio of nimodipine to the functional additives. Following X-ray, DTA and SEM analysis, it was found that nimodipine was highly dispersed and present in the microspheres in an amorphous state. 
Thank you very much for your consideration.
Yours Sincerely,
Prof. Hua Zhang

Highlights

-  three to five result-oriented points that provide readers 
with an at-a-glance overview of the main findings of your article. 
Think of them as a quick snippet of the results—short and sweet. 
Each Highlight must be 85 characters or fewer, including spaces, 
and the Highlights together must *clearly convey only the results of the study*. 
Ideas, concepts and methods are best saved for the abstract or “In Brief” paragraph 
(currently in Cell Press journals only). 
Don't try to capture every piece of data or conclusion. Let the paper do the talking.

Highlights offer your paper an advantage in the online world. 
At a glance, readers can view the results of a manuscript and 
quickly identify what they want to read, without having to dig through abstracts. The more eyes scanning your Highlights, the easier it is for readers to discover something they might not have stumbled upon otherwise.
The nitty gritty

    Not part of editorial consideration and aren't required until the final files stage
    Only required for full research articles
    Must be provided as a Word document— select "Highlights" from the drop-down list when uploading files
    Each Highlight can be no more than 85 characters, including spaces.
    No jargon, acronyms, or abbreviations; aim for a general audience and use keywords
    Consider the reader—Highlights are the first thing they'll see

Examples

From: Cancer Cell, Volume 32, Issue 2, 14 August 2017, Pages 169-184.e7

Highlights:

    Metastases mostly disseminate late from primary breast tumors, keeping most drivers
    Drivers at relapse sample from a wider range of cancer genes than in primary tumors
    Mutations in SWI-SNF complex and inactivated JAK-STAT signaling enriched at relapse
    Mutational processes similar in primary and relapse; radiotherapy can damage genome

From: Learning and Instruction, Volume 21, Issue 6, December 2011, 746-756

Highlights:

    Fading of a script alone does not foster domain-general strategy knowledge
    Performance of the strategy declines during the fading of a script
    Monitoring by a peer keeps performance of the strategy up during script fading
    Performance of a strategy after fading fosters domain-general strategy knowledge
    Fading and monitoring by a peer combined foster domain-general strategy knowledge

Specific comments:
1. The target journals that I sent, are not of Elesiver, so you must remove the note "preprint to Elesiver" or any mention of Elesiver. You should also add a reference from the target journal in the manuscript (if such ref does not already exist in the manuscript).
2. Changed the name location between me and Mining.
3. Figs 15 and 19; the locations of the rotors are not clear.
  + rotor is 
4. Figs 11, 15 and 19; there is some zebra ruler in the figures with (m). Is this to give length scale?
 So why the units are in meter?
  + Yes, the zeba ruler is used for length scale, the default unit is meter in the software, I have find ways to change its seting on units and font size.



Let me know if you need potential reviewers for the submission.

*Park model:*
We have to give some indication how to improve the Park model to 
enhance the originality of the paper. 

The least square operation is *non-linear* because of the formulation of the Park model 
and thus gnuplot may have not converged to the best solution. 
However, looking again at Fig 10b, the recovery looks to me less parabolic 
and more linear and thus you can try best fit by keep k=0.04 
but fitting the power of (D/(D+2kX))^n, i.e. fit n. 
Because we use RANS results for the wake it is more reasonable to use the C_T from RANS, 
unless you believe the BEM is more accurate. 
You can try both C_T from BEM and C_T from RANS.

*Low TI, fitting Park model:*
We need to write in the text how to better fit for low TI, 
if we don't show it in the graph. 
You can also add in the text a comparison with that experimental data. 
Please run gnuplot to see that we can fit by changing n the power of (D/(D+2kX))^n. 
It is important, because the manuscript does not have top originality at the moment 
and every little extra will help if we stumble upon an awkward reviewer.

*Target journal:*
It is likely renewable energy will reject the manuscript, you can try the following:

Journal of Ocean Engineering and Marine Energy (Springer), Q1 in Scimago
International Journal of Offshore and Polar Engineering, Q2 in Scimago
Ocean Systems Engineering (Techno Press), Q2 in Scimago

- why change symmetry BC to free slip wall BC
  free slip wall

Fig. 10 , can you fit a new k to agree with RANS results for TI=1%

***  k fit
For TSR = 15%
k = 0.017 based on C_T from RANS
K = 0.020 based on C_T from BEM


Goal: fit the Park model to the RANS results. 

- Best fit :: it means changing k until it best fits the RANS results.

Many modern plotting software has best fit options. 
for example in =gnuplot= the following script can be used to best fit the park model:

#+begin_src 
# write the value of a which is u_inf*(1-sqrt(1-C_T))
a = .... 
#write the value of the diameter D
d = .....
f(x) = a*d*d/((d+2*k*x)*(d+2*k*x))
# res.dat is the file containing two columns of x, C_T 
fit f(x) via k
plot 'res.dat' with lines lw 1, f(x) lw 3 title "best fitted"
#+end_src 

#+begin_src 
# write the value of a which is u_inf*(1-sqrt(1-C_T)), U_inf =0.6
a = 0.6*(1-sqrt(1-0.7133))
#write the value of the diameter D
d =0.46
f(x) = (0.6-a*d*d/((d+2*k*x)*(d+2*k*x)))/0.6
# res.dat is the file containing two columns of x, C_T 
fit f(x) 'ux_ti_1.dat' using 1:2 via k
plot 'ux_ti_1.dat' with points lw 1, f(x) lw 3 title "best fitted"

*** Does RANS under-predict post stall Cl?

** TODO question
1. How do you explain the small differences from RANS and large
differences from exp tests for TI effects on CP, Ct?
- Fig6, dual rotor 

answer: The experimental data does not include error bar,
the measuared sample data  showed a maximum deviations

2. parameters affect the wake velocity recover rate
- TI
- mixing mechanism

3. The overall \(C_P\) of the dual-rotor MCT is 5% higher than its single-rotor counterpart based on the RANS and  BEM-Park model results.
- based on BEM-Park Model, Cp_dual is about 10% higher than Cp_single

4. Free slip wall to Symmetry BC

5. C_T value in K fit 
why use c_t from RANS rather than from BEM
| Rotor | TSR |    CT | TI(%) | methods |
| front |   5 | 0.670 |     1 | RANS    |
| front |   5 | 0.660 |    15 | RANS    |

** submission - Journal of Ocean Engineering and Marine Energy (Springer), Q1 in Scimago
** typos
This is because the Park model ** correctly predicted the velocity recovery after the front rotor when compared to the RANS prediction  
This analysis shows that there is going to improve low Park model to better account the incoming TI. It also assumes the rotational plane of rotor  is orthogonal to the incoming tidal current.

** Feedback- eldad

You should also add a reference from the target journal in the manuscript (if such ref does not already exist in the manuscript).
2. Changed the name location between me and Mining.
3. Figs 15 and 19; the locations
of the rotors are not clear.
4. Figs 11, 15 and 19; there is some zebra ruler in the figures with (m). Is this to give length scale? So why the units are in meter?

Please correct and submit.

Let me know if you need potential reviewers for the submission.





Please see attached for my comments. They seem quite a lot, but this manuscript is on its way for submission level.
 I would like to see it once more before it is submitted.

As for the target journal, International journal of marine energy looks as a good one.

Please email me the next version before Thursday June 20th (I will go away for a week afterwards(.

As for the best-fit k, we just need to write the values of best k in the text for the case of TSR_front=5. The best fit k for TI=1% needs to be recalculated.


you should use the RAN valus for k fit

** FAQ
In conclusion section

*Q: How did you get the following conclusion?*
"In general, the CFD reuslts shows taht the BEM-Park model provides reasonable 
accuracy fot the total power performance of the dual-rotor MCT."

answer: based on Fig.9, The Cp_dual from RANS is idential to Cp_dual from BEM, When
 - In RANS,  \( TSR_{U_{\infty}}^{front}\) = 5, while \( TSR_{U_{\infty}}^{rear} \) = 3.2
 - In BEM,  

\begin{equation}
TSR_{\overline{U}}^{rear} = \frac{\Omega _2 R}{\overline{U}} = TSR_{U_{\infty}}^{front} = \frac{\Omega _1 R}{U_\infty}
\end{equation} 

** revision statement
## corrected text are hightlighted in bold.

section 3 *Numerical methods*
- add explanation on BEM-Park model

section 4.1, grid convergence, only pressure coefficient at three different mesh sizes, no Cp VS TSR at different mesh sizes because that would take lots of compuatation.

- Fig. 6, effect of TI on Cp, ct  at TI-1% and 15%, a max 3% reduction of Cp was observed
*question: is Cp much lower at TI=15%?*
- only 3\% lower in Cp, but much high reduction was observed in literature.

- Fig. 8, only CP, Ct of rear rotor is given (dual-rotor turbine)

*Fig. 9*

 *Question1: Are these '+" dots for single-rotor or dual  from RANS*
- *Answer:*  '+' is for Single-rotor

*Question2: is the BEM has the same TSR as of RANS?*
  + for RANS,  \( TSR_{U_{\infty}}^{front}\) = 5, while \( TSR_{U_{\infty}}^{rear} \) = 3.2
  +  For BEM,  

\begin{equation}
TSR_{\overline{U}}^{rear} = \frac{\Omega _2 R}{\overline{U}} = TSR_{U_{\infty}}^{front} = \frac{\Omega _1 R}{U_\infty}

1. 去研究风口行业，判断未来的方向。太短太长都不行，孙忠义说的，3-5年，问问学长，去咨询那些已经工作的人。
2. 
2，做事重要，但做人同样重要，无论是跳槽还是创业，人脉都是你最宝贵的资源。但人脉不是加个微信那么简单，朋友圈点赞那不是人脉，想想你能给他们提供什么。
3. 3，不要等到什么都准备好了再行动。真实的职场环境是没有“准备好再行动“这个道理的，你永远都不可能准备好，也没有时间给你准备。边做边学，用做互联网产品的思维，慢慢完善，优化迭代

** modern renewable energy
- biomass ::  plant or animal material used for energy production.
- traditional Biomass :: Solid biomass including fuel wood, charcoal,
agricultural and forest residues, and animal dung, that typically
is used in rural areas of developing countries with traditional
technologies such as open fires for cooking, kilns, and ovens for
cooking and residential heating as well as small-scale agricultural
and industrial processing. 

Often the use of traditional biomass leads
to high pollution levels, forest degradation and deforestation.

Renewable technologies with exception to traditional biomass are often termed 'modern renewables'. 
These include hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and modern biofuel production (including modern forms of waste-to-biomass conversion).

* ECE 210: Analog Signal Processing
https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece210/su2019/
About the Course:

ECE 210 is the first mathematically oriented course 
in the electrical and computer engineering curricula. 
The course begins by building on the circuit analysis concepts
 you learned in ECE 110 and then progresses into the more abstract world of Fourier and Laplace transforms.
 Much of what we will do will rely on your background in calculus. Our goal will be to apply mathematical tools to the analysis and design of signal processing systems, culminating in a thorough understanding of an AM radio receiver and the ability to design simple filters. ECE 210 deals with the processing of continuous-time, or analog signals. The follow-on course, ECE 310, covers the processing of sampled, or digital signals.

Course Goals

ECE 210 is a required 4-hour course for both electrical engineering and computer engineering majors. The goals are to provide a solid foundation in analog signal processing that will serve as a strong base for further study in digital signal processing, communications, remote sensing, control, and electronics. Topics include circuit analysis, continuous- time linear system theory, Laplace and Fourier transforms, AM radio, and basic analog filter design. The course includes five laboratories to give students hands-on experience in exercising the theoretical concepts learned in class. The labs contain significant components of categories (1), (2), and (6) under Criterion 3, ABET Program Outcomes and Assessment. ECE 211 is the first half of ECE 210 and is taught as a service course for students outside electrical and computer engineering.

** Wake model correction and validation

** Validation -- solving the right equations

- validation :: the process of determing the degree to which a model is an 
accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of 
the intended uses of the model (AIAA G-077-1998)

Validation examines if the conceptual models, computational models
as implemented into the CFD code, and computational simulation agree with
real world observations.

The strategy is to indentify and quantify error and uncertainty through
comparison of simulation results with experimental data.


It is not possible to validate the entire CFD code.

One can only validate the code for a specific range of applications for which
there is *experimental data*. Thus one validates a *model* or *simulation*.

Applying the code to flows beyond the region of validity is termed *prediction*.

Errors of experiment data sets:
1. bias error
2. random error

*The approach to Validation Assessment*
-  perform a systematic comparison of CFD simulation results to experimental data from a set increasingly complex cases.
*** Validation Assessment Process

The process for Validation Assessment of a CFD simulation can be summarized as:

1. [[Examining Iterative Convergence]]
Validation assessment requires that a simulation demonstrates iterative convergence. 


2. Examine Consistency.
One should check for consistency in the CFD solution. For example, the flow in a duct should maintain mass conservation through the duct. Further total pressure recovery in an inlet should stay constant or decrease through the duct.

3. Examine Spatial (Grid) Convergence. :GCI:

The CFD simulation results should demonstrate spatial convergence. 

4. Examine Temporal Convergence.
The CFD simulation results should demonstrate temporal convergence. 

5. Compare CFD Results to *Experimental* Data.
*Experimental data* is the observation of the "real world" in some controlled manner. 
By comparing the CFD results to experimental data, 
one hopes that there is a good agreement, 
which inreases confidence that the physical models 
and the code represents the "real world" for this class of simulations. 
However, the experimental data contains some level of error. 
This is usually related to the complexity of the experiment. 
Validation assessment calls for a "building block" approach of experiments 
which sets a hierarchy of experiment complexity.

*Question: Can I use CFD data for validation?*


6. Examine *Model Uncertainties*
*The physical models in the CFD code* contain uncertainties
 due to a lack of complete understanding or knowledge of the physical processes. 
One of the models with the most uncertainty is the *turbulence models*. 
The uncertainty can be examined by running a number of simulations 
with the *various turbulence models* and examine the affect on the results. 

*** Examining Iterative Convergence

Generally, CFD methods involve some iterative scheme to arrive at the simulation results. 
Here it is assumed that the iteration is with respect to time
 or a pseudo-temporal quantity and some type of time step is taken at each iteration. 
A steady-state flow simulation involves starting with a uniform 
or fabricated flow field and iterating in time until
 the steady-state flow field is obtained. 
This is termed iterative convergence, but requires some criteria for determining convergence. 

*Criteria include:*

1. *Residuals*. 

The residuals of the equations are the change in the equations over an iteration. These are usually scaled or normalized. One usually looks for the residuals to reach a certain level and then level-off as an indication of iterative convergence. For a time-marching, steady-state strategy, this involves examining whether the residual has been reduced a certain number (usually 3-4) of orders of magnitude.

2. *Results*

The CFD simulation has the objective of determining some quantity 
such as lift, drag, recovery, etc... 
One can track the values of such engineering quantities with respect to iteration and define iterative convergence when these quantities converge. The convergence criteria is usually defined by acceptable error in these values. It is often the case that certain quantities may reach convergence at a different rate than other quantities. One can check that a monitored flow value (such as thrust, drag, or boundary layer profile) has remained unchanged with respect to the number of iterations.

3. *Time-Accurate Simulations*

For a time-marching, time-accurate strategy, this involves examining whether the final time has been reached with proper convergence at each time step.

4. *Space-Marching Simulation*

 For a space-marching strategy, 
this involves examining whether the end of the marching segment has been reached with proper convergence at each marching step.

** Vortex dual rotor
there is a huge vortex in front of the rear rotor (last figure), 
which means that the space between the two rotors behaves as an open cavity. 
The distance between the two rotor is 8R (R=D/2) where a cavity starts to be behave as a closed cavity. Such cavity will occur for a distance of 12R (i.e. X=6D). Can you do runs for X=6D and X=8D and one run on the other side of range of distance, i.e. X=D/2?

Choose the pitch orientation of the rotors that you feel will yield the best performance.

If you use the term "turbulent wake" the examiners will want to see the level of turbulence, e.g. a contour plot of the turbulent kinetic energy and/or turbulent intensity.

Poststall Hysteresis and Flowfield Unsteadiness on a NACA 0012 Airfoil

Fourier analysis of the surface pressure distributions show that
the unsteadiness is due to:
1. low frequency, high amplitude oscillation near the LE (dominant for the upstroke branch)
2. a regular bluff-body shedding frequency across the separated region of the airfoil  (dominant for the downstroke branch)

** dual rotor-- replay from eldad
If the agreement between BEM and Fluent for a single rotor is good, 
then it is likely to be the Park model that causes the difference. 

1. CFD RANS may not accurate due to the separated flow when the pitch angle is \theta=-2 degree
2. Cl cd data in the bem code
Is cl. cd vs aoa corrected by the viterna's method in the BEM-code? 
airfoil polar data is exprapolated then read in the bem-code?




Can you modify the Park model and re-run the BEM calculation? 
What is causing the Fluent Cp to be so low, 
is it a very negative Cp from the rear rotor or was the front rotor also affected?

answer: Only  one rotor with wrong pitch direction

Local AOA at different TSRs (e387,BEM)
file:figures/WindTurbine/aoa_blade_stations_TSR.png

classical BEM gives adequate results under normal operating
conditions near the *design TSR*

Problems:

at both high and low TSRs, the wind turbine may operate in flow 
conditons which are not easily analyzed by classical theory.

*high AOAs at low TSRs*
Recent tests on the NASA mod-o 100 kw wind turbine, for example, indicate
that the classical theory is inadepate at low TSRs when
the airfoils are at high AOAs.

*Vortex ring state at high TSRs*
at high TSRs, the rotor may operate in the vortex ring state in which
a vortex ring is formed in the rotor plane.
unser this conditon, an eddy motion occurs, such as behind a bluff body, and
the overall thrust force on the rotor can deviate significantly from values given
by momentum theory (ref.3). Furthermore, from a practical viewpoint, analysis of this 
state using momentum theory can cause difficult convergence problems
 and result in unrealistic values in the caluclaiton of the induced flow velocities.

they state that turbulent kinetic energy for LES = 1/2 * (Velocity.Trnrms^2 -Velocity.Trnavg^2)

or = 1/2 * (statistics reynolds stresses uu + ...vv + ....ww)

statistical reynolds stresses are automatically calculated for the LES/SAS-SST and DES models. While .Trnrms and .Trnavg files are transient result files that have to be turned on in the output section.

***  How to 
There is a second direct method with which there are no arguments.
Create a 2D plane (2d plane instead of 3d to reduce amount of data and offcourse size of the files)
 in your geometry and extract data for each time-step in that plane. 
choose the three velocity components, the three directions and any other parameters that you wish.
Now, i extracted these parameters in the *.txt files and then used matlab to create matrices for each parameter. 
This way you will have instantaneous velocity profiles at each time-step. 
averaging over the whole time-step will give you the mean velocity flow profiles.. 
Then substracting the mean from each instantenous profile will give you the fluctuating component 
at each time-step. 
estimate the square of each component and then accordingly, 
you will have instantanous turbulence kinetic energy at each time-step. 
estimate the mean of TKE over the whole time-step to find the mean TKE. 
Its very easy to do all of this in matlab. If need be, i can help you with matlab code..

*** in Fluent
FLUENT's implementation of LES model doesn't explicitly solve the equation for the subgrid turbulent kinetic energy. However, this variable is available during post-processing under the category of turbulent variables. The FLUENT12.1 user's guide provides the equation (31.4.39) which is used to calculate the value of subgrid turbulent kinetic energy.

However, how to access this variable on C-side, i.e. in a UDF?
/*UDF to retrieve the Subgrid Turbulent Kinetic Energy with LES model*/

/*
Information:- FLUENT's implementation of LES turbulence model doesn't explicitly solve the equation for "Subgrid turbulent kinetic energy". However, it can be retrieved as a post-processing variable. The subgrid turbulent kinetic energy is defined by the equation 31.4.3 (refer FLUENT12.1 User's Guide).

This UDF (which is of DEFINE_ON_DEMAND type) actually solves the equation to get the value of subgrid turbulent kinetic energy. The calculated value of Turbulent kinetic energy is stored in a USER DEFINED MEMORY (UDM).

A variable SMALL is defined to avoid division by zero. This has a hard coded value in FLUENT and hence not required to assign any explicit value in this UDF.


How to use the udf:-
o Read the case and data file of the LES case.
o Define a UDM through Define-->User Defined-->Memory
o Compile and Load the udf through Define-->User Defined-->Compiled.
o Perform iterations.
o Go to Define-->User Defined-->Execute-on-demand and Execute the function "cal_k_subgrid".
o This will store the value of subgrid turbulent kinetic energy in UDM-0.

o Note that this udf works fine on both serial and parallel FLUENT. Both are been tested on Linux clusters with pnet and smpi communicators.

** RANS vs. LES

***  Grid Dependence
You should notice that one of differences between RANS models and LES models is grid. for RANS models results are independence on grid sizes. i mean if your mesh size be decreased from specific size your results be same. it is desirable mesh size for RANS models and you don't need to fine it more.
But in LES models, results have grid dependency. less sizes more accuracy. in very fine meshes your results can be reach to DNS results. in this situation you solve all of your flow instead of modelling.

** array vs matrix
http://www.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users/

 Numpy contains both an array class and a matrix class. The array class is intended to be a general-purpose n-dimensional array for many kinds of numerical computing, while matrixis intended to facilitate linear algebra computations specifically. In practice there are only a handful of key differences between the two.

    Operator *, dot(), and multiply():

        For array, '*' means element-wise multiplication, and the dot() function is used for matrix multiplication.

        For matrix, '*' means matrix multiplication, and the multiply() function is used for element-wise multiplication.
    Handling of vectors (rank-1 arrays)

        For array, the vector shapes 1xN, Nx1, and N are all different things. Operations like A[:,1] return a rank-1 array of shape N, not a rank-2 of shape Nx1. Transpose on a rank-1 array does nothing.

        For matrix, rank-1 arrays are always upconverted to 1xN or Nx1 matrices (row or column vectors). A[:,1] returns a rank-2 matrix of shape Nx1.

    Handling of higher-rank arrays (rank > 2)

        array objects can have rank > 2.

        matrix objects always have exactly rank 2.
    Convenience attributes

        array has a .T attribute, which returns the transpose of the data.

        matrix also has .H, .I, and .A attributes, which return the conjugate transpose, inverse, and asarray() of the matrix, respectively.
    Convenience constructor

        The array constructor takes (nested) Python sequences as initializers. As in, array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]).

        The matrix constructor additionally takes a convenient string initializer. As in matrix("[1 2 3; 4 5 6]").

There are pros and cons to using both:

    array

        :) You can treat rank-1 arrays as either row or column vectors. dot(A,v) treats v as a column vector, while dot(v,A) treats v as a row vector. This can save you having to type a lot of transposes.

        <:( Having to use the dot() function for matrix-multiply is messy -- dot(dot(A,B),C) vs. A*B*C.

        :) Element-wise multiplication is easy: A*B.

        :) array is the "default" NumPy type, so it gets the most testing, and is the type most likely to be returned by 3rd party code that uses NumPy.

        :) Is quite at home handling data of any rank.

        :) Closer in semantics to tensor algebra, if you are familiar with that.

        :) All operations (*, /, +, ** etc.) are elementwise

    matrix

        :\ Behavior is more like that of MATLAB® matrices.

        <:( Maximum of rank-2. To hold rank-3 data you need array or perhaps a Python list of matrix.

        <:( Minimum of rank-2. You cannot have vectors. They must be cast as single-column or single-row matrices.

        <:( Since array is the default in NumPy, some functions may return an array even if you give them a matrix as an argument. This shouldn't happen with NumPy functions (if it does it's a bug), but 3rd party code based on NumPy may not honor type preservation like NumPy does.

        :) A*B is matrix multiplication, so more convenient for linear algebra.

        <:( Element-wise multiplication requires calling a function, multipy(A,B).

        <:( The use of operator overloading is a bit illogical: * does not work elementwise but / does.

The array is thus much more advisable to use, but in the end, you don't really have to choose one or the other. You can mix-and-match. You can use array for the bulk of your code, and switch over to matrix in the sections where you have nitty-gritty linear algebra with lots of matrix-matrix multiplications.

copyfile() copies one file’s contents into another. For this, the target should be writable; otherwise, it raises an IOError. When the destination is a directory, it raises Error 13. And like we discussed previously, these methods replace a destination file if it already exists and throw an error if the source and destination names are the same.

We have the following syntax for it:

shutil.copyfile(src_file, dest_file, *, follow_symlinks=True)

Let’s try the following code:

    >>> import os,shutil
    >>> os.chdir('C:\\Users\\lifei\\Desktop')
    >>> shutil.copyfile('1.txt','2.txt')
    '2.txt'

This code gives us the name of the file it created. Also, when we set the follow_symlinks argument to False, it creates a symbolic link from the source file, which is a symbolic link, instead of copying it.

** sys.argv-- a list in python
- sys.argv :: a *list of strings* representing the arguments (as separated by spaces)
 on the command line.


~sys.argv[0]~  # script name
- len(sys.argv) :: count the number of arguments

Santax: list[start:end:step]


sys.argv is created by your command line, it's a list of your command line arguments.

For example:

in your command line you input something like this,

  ~python3.2 file.py something~

=sys.argv= will become a list =['file.py', 'something']=

In this case  , sys.argv[1] = 'something'


** command line argument in python
In the *command line*, we can start a program with 
additional arguments. These *arguments* are passed *into the program*.

e.g.
    ~$ python program.py image.bmp~

where the program is =python=, and 
 =program.py= and =image.bmp= are *arguments*

    print('howdy!!!')
    print('hello there.')

hello()   # function call
hello()
hello()
#+END_SRC

*** return values and statements
a return statement consists of the following:
- the =return= keyword
- the value/expression that the function should return
*** the None value
- None :: the absence of a value, similar as =null, nill= in =C programming=
*** keyword arguments and print()
input:
print('hello', end='')
print('world')

** in time vs on time


"In time" usually has an implicit "for (some event)", whereas "on time" means "before some deadline".

The "event" could be a deadline, but in that case "on time" is much more common.

Examples:

"I got there in time for the parade"

"I delivered the report in time for him to read it before the meeting"

"I got to town in time (for)/(to catch) the last train"

"I got there in time" - meaning "in time for some event which is assumed to be known".

but

"I got there on time" - meaning "before the deadline" - which may be known to the hearer, but does not need to be, because the phrase itself implies a deadline as opposed to some other event.

the rear rotor far from optimally pitched.

2. This will include prediction of the hydrodynamic power and and blade

surface waves are to be considered.

3.  Both the unsteady BEM coupled gravity wave theory

As an illustration, suppose that we are interested in 
the properties of a function f(n) as n becomes very large. If f(n) = n^2 + 3n, 
then as =n= becomes very large, the term =3n= becomes 
insignificant compared to \(n^2\). 
The function \( f(n) \) is said to be "asymptotically equivalent to \(n^2\), 
as n → ∞". 
This is often written symbolically as \( f(n) ~ n^2 \), 
which is read as " \( f(n)\) is asymptotic to n2".

At present, the study of surface wave mechanics are concentrated predominantly on three
aspects.
1. wave mechanics was treated as pure mathenatical problem, important also for numerical modelling
2. dynamics of surface waves were used to esitmate the resultant wave loads on offshore

** Yaw
yaw control for tidal turbine

the turbine always operates facing the oncoming current.

a yaw system is required to ensure realignment to the changing
tide; approximately every six hours. Tidal currents are
generally in a consistent direction during a single ebb or 
flood tide, so the yaw can be fixed when the turbine is
generating, and the yaw system only needs to be activiated 
at slack water, between tides. 
The AR1500 has a novel yaw locking mechanism which makes for 
a compact simple design

# definition of current
- current :: the motion of water when used in assiciation with water
categories of current based on driving forces.

- tial current :: current driven by tides in the oceans, near the shore, and in bays and estuaries along the coast.[1]

reason
- tidal currents are a result of the rise and fall of the 
water level due to tides ( a vertical motion)

- flood flow :: the tidal current is in flood 
when it is coming from the sea to the shore ( tide is 
coming in , or high tide is ensuing)

- ebb flow :: the tidal current iss in ebb when it 
is coming from shore and returning to the sea ( low tide ensuing)

current types
- Gravity : rainwater, water in a creek, river flowing from higher elevation to lower elevation
- Oceanic currents are driven by several factors:
  + rise and fall of the tides driven by the gravitational attraction of the sun and moon on earth's oceans.
 + wind
 + density difference

**  Velocity at real sea condition
Why is it important to test in real sea conditions?
It was important for us to test and validate our technology, as well as to improve efficiency and performance through our work at EMEC. We also were able to test our components and sub-components and how they would function in a real marine environment. Testing at a facility such as EMEC is important not only in terms of refining our turbine and power system, but also more broadly in terms of showcasing our technology to potential investors and clients.

** HAWT VS VAWT
Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT)

Horizontal axis wind turbines, also shortened to HAWT, 
are the common style that most of us think of when we think of a wind turbine. 
A HAWT has a similar design to a windmill, it has blades that look like a propeller that spin on the horizontal axis.

Horizontal axis wind turbines have the main rotor shaft and electrical generator at the top of a tower, and they must be pointed into the wind. Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind vane placed square with the rotor (blades), while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a servo motor to turn the turbine into the wind. Most large wind turbines have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the rotor into a faster rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator.

Since a tower produces turbulence behind it, the turbine is usually pointed upwind of the tower. Wind turbine blades are made stiff to prevent the blades from being pushed into the tower by high winds. Additionally, the blades are placed a considerable distance in front of the tower and are sometimes tilted up a small amount.

Downwind machines have been built, despite the problem of turbulence, because they don’t need an additional mechanism for keeping them in line with the wind. Additionally, in high winds the blades can be allowed to bend which reduces their swept area and thus their wind resistance. Since turbulence leads to fatigue failures, and reliability is so important, most HAWTs are upwind machines.

HAWT Advantages

    The tall tower base allows access to stronger wind in sites with wind shear. In some wind shear sites, every ten meters up the wind speed can increase by 20% and the power output by 34%.
    High efficiency, since the blades always move perpendicularly to the wind, receiving power through the whole rotation. In contrast, all vertical axis wind turbines, and most proposed airborne wind turbine designs, involve various types of reciprocating actions, requiring airfoil surfaces to backtrack against the wind for part of the cycle. Backtracking against the wind leads to inherently lower efficiency.

HAWT Disadvantages

    Massive tower construction is required to support the heavy blades, gearbox, and generator.
    Components of a horizontal axis wind turbine (gearbox, rotor shaft and brake assembly) being lifted into position.
    Their height makes them obtrusively visible across large areas, disrupting the appearance of the landscape and sometimes creating local opposition.
    Downwind variants suffer from fatigue and structural failure caused by turbulence when a blade passes through the tower’s wind shadow (for this reason, the majority of HAWTs use an upwind design, with the rotor facing the wind in front of the tower).
    HAWTs require an additional yaw control mechanism to turn the blades toward the wind.
    HAWTs generally require a braking or yawing device in high winds to stop the turbine from spinning and destroying or damaging itself.
    Cyclic Stresses & Vibration – When the turbine turns to face the wind, the rotating blades act like a gyroscope. As it pivots, gyroscopic precession tries to twist the turbine into a forward or backward somersault. For each blade on a wind generator’s turbine, force is at a minimum when the blade is horizontal and at a maximum when the blade is vertical. This cyclic twisting can quickly fatigue and crack the blade roots, hub and axle of the turbines.

Traditional Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT)

Vertical axis wind turbines, as shortened to VAWTs, have the main rotor shaft arranged vertically. The main advantage of this arrangement is that the wind turbine does not need to be pointed into the wind. This is an advantage on sites where the wind direction is highly variable or has turbulent winds.

With a vertical axis, the generator and other primary components can be placed near the ground, so the tower does not need to support it, also makes maintenance easier. The main drawback of a VAWT is it generally creates drag when rotating into the wind.

It is difficult to mount vertical-axis turbines on towers, meaning they are often installed nearer to the base on which they rest, such as the ground or a building rooftop. The wind speed is slower at a lower altitude, so less wind energy is available for a given size turbine. Air flow near the ground and other objects can create turbulent flow, which can introduce issues of vibration, including noise and bearing wear which may increase the maintenance or shorten its service life. However, when a turbine is mounted on a rooftop, the building generally redirects wind over the roof, thus doubling the wind speed at the turbine. If the height of the rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50% of the building height, this is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence.

Traditional VAWT Advantages
    +  VATT has its advantages in terms of the structural efficiency and easier maintaneous
    They can produce electricity in any wind direction.

-  Strong supporting tower in not needed because generator, gearbox 
and other components are placed on the ground.
-    Low production cost as compared to horizontal axis wind turbines.

-    As there is no need of pointing turbine in wind direction to be efficient so yaw drive and pitch mechanism is not needed.
    Easy installation as compared to other wind turbine.
    Easy to transport from one place to other.
    Low maintenance costs.
    They can be installed in urban areas.
    Low risk for human and birds because blades moves at relatively low speeds.
    They are particularly suitable for areas with extreme weather conditions, like in the mountains where they can supply electricity to mountain huts.

Traditional VAWT Disadvantages

    As only one blade of the wind turbine works at a time, efficiency is very low compared to HAWTS.
    They need an initial push to start; this initial push that to make the blades start spinning on their own must be started by a small motor.
    When compared to horizontal axis wind turbines they are very less efficient because of the additional drag created when their blades rotate.
    They have relative high vibration because the air flow near the ground creates turbulent flow.
    Because of vibration, bearing wear increases which results in the increase of maintenance costs.
    They can create noise pollution.
    VAWTs may need guy wires to hold it up (guy wires are impractical and heavy in farm areas).

*** OpenHydro
Another type of ducted tidal turbine is the Open Centre Turbine by Open Hydro. The
turbine concept uses permanent magnet rim generator which makes electricity from the turbine
less complex as compared to ordinary gear drive trains. They have tested the Open Centre
Turbine in the Fall of Warness site of EMEC in 2006 and successfully generated electricity for
the Scottish Grid in May, 2008. The current design of the turbine is a 16m rotor with 2MW of
power capacity (Openhydro, 2017).

Established in 2005, Dublin-based OpenHydro designs and manufactures marine turbines
 to generate renewable energy from tidal streams.

OpenHydro was the first developer to use the tidal test site at the Fall of Warness off
 the island of Eday when its test rig and 250kW open centred turbine were installed in 2006. 
The device was the first tidal turbine to be grid connected
 in Scotland and subsequently the first to successfully
 generate electricity to the national grid in the UK.

The test rig consists of two steel monopoles grouted into sockets drilled into the seabed,
 with a platform suspended from the piles to provide a working area. 
The turbine, which is six metres in diameter,
 is fixed to the piles using two steel collars, 
which allow the unit to be lowered into the sea using two 15 tonne hydraulic winches.
 The test rig allowed the turbine to be raised out of the water easily, 
reducing the cost and time for testing, maintaining and updating the device.

To aid navigation, the test rig is painted yellow and yellow light (solar powered) 
is fitted in accordance with NLB requirements. The platform is also equipped with an AIS transponder.

As the Open-Centre Turbine was designed to be deployed directly 
on the seabed using a gravity base,
 OpenHydro placed a blank, non-grid connected turbine 
on the seabed adjoining their test rig using the specially commissioned 
“OpenHydro Installer” in summer 2008.

Whilst progressing larger demonstration projects in Canada and France, 
OpenHydro continued to bring subsequent generations of their device 
for testing on their test rig at EMEC. 
Their 7th generation 6m diameter turbine was installed in their test rig in April 2014 
and accrued over 10,000 hours of run time.

Unfortunately, in July 2018, their parent company, Naval Energies, 
made the decision to liquidate the company.

http://www.openhydro.com/home.html
*** flumill
Flumill were the first company to use EMEC’s non-grid connected tidal test site at Shapinsay Sound in 2011.
  They have been developing the patented Flumill system  since 2002. 
 The system is based on a solid helix screw specifically designed for water based streams. 
Water streams are almost 1000 times more powerful than air and therefore require a very robust system.   The Flumill systems can operate in ocean/tidal streams at less than 1m/s flow and can be adapted for use in rivers.


** steady flow
Steady flow
  + strict definition
    A steady flow is one in which all conditions at any point in a stream *remain constant with respect to time*. 

Or
+ broad definition, mean steady flow
    A steady flow is the one in which the quantity of liquid flowing per second through any section, is constant.

This is the definition for the ideal case. 
True steady flow is present only in Laminar flow. 
In turbulent flow, there are continual fluctuations in velocity. 
Pressure also fluctuate at every point. 
But if this rate of change of pressure and velocity are equal on both sides of a constant average value, 
the flow is steady flow. The exact term use for this is *mean steady flow*.

Steady flow may be uniform or non-uniform.

In particular, the effect of yaw angle, rotor immersion, and the interference between twin rotors were stu- died. Cavitation inception studies are also reported

*Gaurier et al., 2013*

Wave–current interaction studies (Gaurier et al., 2013) have shown that free- surface waves induce additional cyclic loading on turbine blades and fatigue conditions are dominated by wave-induced loads.


** Turbine types
HAMCT VS VAMCT

Marine current turbines are further classified 
according to the orientation of the turbine axis with respect to the dominant direction of the current. 
Turbines operating with the axis aligned with the current are referred to as horizontal axis turbines 
to distinguish from cross- flow turbines in which the axis is orthogonal to the current direction. 
Vertical-axis turbines represent a particular case of cross-flow turbines.

** Physcial model test vs Numerical modeling

*why Numerical model?*
- saving cost
- time saving
- numerical methods are primarily used ot achieve a *preliminary* validation of concepts.
- give more detials of flow field aournd the device
- parametric studies to investigate responce to different
operating conditions or to optimse geometry details.
- provide data for the structural design of the overall system
- provide aspects that can not be reproduced by physical tests, this includes:
  + scale effects on results of laboratory tests carried out on small models
  + multiple devce operations in array
  + impact of energy capture on the environment


In general, computational modelling provides analysis and design tools that 
are *complementary* to testing physical models in laboratories and field sites.
([[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2015.05.036][A.H.Day, 2015 ocean engineering]])
In particular, aspects that can not be 
reproduced b physical tests can be investigated by numerical simulations.
# examples
This inculdes, for instance, estimation of scale effects on
results of laboratory tests caried out on small 
models in order to provide reference data
for the design of full-scale prototypes to be 
deploed in open water.

The analysis of multiple device operations in arrays and the 
impact of energy capture on the environment are other 
examples of applications of computational models.

%% introduction, problem ans solution proposal

%% definition:what is VOF?
The volume of fluid (VOF) model is one of the Euler-Euler multiphase models which are suitable for slug or free surface flows where different phases are immiscible \cite{fluent2017theory}.
%% assumptions, governing eqs
% concept of volume fraction
The volume fraction is the basic concept in the VOF model. The sum of volume fractions is 1 as Eq. \ref{eq:volumeFraction}.
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=0}^{n} \alpha _q =1
	\label{eq:volumeFraction}
\end{equation}
In the Eq. \ref{eq:volumeFraction}, \(\alpha_q\) is the volume fraction of \(q^{th}\) fluid.
For multiphase flows, the volume fraction of a phase is a new variable in the computational cell and physical quantities are volumed averaged.
For example, the volume averaged density of an n-phase flow can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \alpha _q \rho_q
\end{equation}

% continuity Eq
The continuity equation for the  \(q^{th}\) fluid can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{\rho q}[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\alpha _q \rho _q) + \nabla \cdot(\alpha _q \rho _q v_q)]=S_{\alpha_q} + \sum_{p=1}^{n} (\dot{m_{pq}}-\dot{m_{qp}})
\end{equation}
Where \(\dot{m_{pq}\) denotes the mass transfer from phase \(q\) to phase \(p\) and vice versa. \(S_{\alpha_q}\) is a source term, which is zero by default. The volume fraction equation can be calculated in either explict or implicit time methods.
% moomentum Eqs
The momentum equation for multiphase flow takes the same form as its single phase counterpaort. However, the \(\rho \) and \(\mu\) are volume averaged values in the momentum equation. The volume of fluid  model solve a single set of momentum equations and the resulting velocity and pressure quantites are the same by all fluid phases. 
% volume fraction equation >> interface tracking	% interpolation near the interface
In post-processing, Fluent provides two approaches for the interface shape interpolation, namely the geometric reconstruction and donaor-acceptor methods.

% surface tension and adhension
The surace tension effects can also be modelled in the VOF model, however its influence is very little and can be ignored for free surface wave in open channel or ocean.

The VOF model can be used for modeling of jet breakup, lage bubbles in a liquid, dam break, and free surface.

** Multiphase modeling
- phase ::  (multiphase flow) an identifiable class of material that has a particular inertial response to and interaction with the flow and the potential field in which it is immersed. 
- immiscible :: not mixable
- soluble ::
- volume fraction are assumed to be continuous functions of space and time
nd their sum is eual to one.
 

physical phases include gas, liquid, and solid, but the concept of phase
 in a multiphase flow system is applied in a broader sense.
# example
For example, *different-sized solid particles of the same material* 
can be treated as different
phases because each collection of particles with the same size will have a similar dynamical response
to the flow field.

- Eluer-Lagrange approach
- Euler-Euler approach:  the different phases are treated mathematically as interpenetrating continua.
  + VOF
  + mixture model
  + Eulerian Model

Physical phases:
  - gas
  - liquid
  - solid

*Gas-Liquid or Liquid-Liquid Flows*

- Bubbly flow :: This is the flow of discrete gaseous or fluid bubbles in a continuous fluid.
- Droplet flow :: This is the flow of discrete fluid droplets in a continuous gas.
- Slug flow :: This is the flow of large bubbles in a continuous fluid.
- Stratified/free-surface flow :: This is the flow of immiscible fluids separated by a clearly-defined interface.
  + stratified flow = free surface flow

** Is air a fluid?
Yes, air is a fluid.

** sliding mesh
- Overset mesh can be especially useful in cases involving large relative motion between components.
# overset( Chimera) mesh vs sliding mesh
The interface between a moving and a static mesh poses a problem in the solution of the flow
field. At the interface between the two meshes, a numerical method must be constructed that allows for
information of the flow field to be transferred across it unimpeded. 
The two common methods to linking
the two meshes is an overset (chimera) mesh or a sliding mesh interface. 
# overset mesh
An overset mesh involves two
overlapping meshes where the flow field is interpolated back and forth. 
# sliding mesh
A sliding mesh interface is
composed of two conformal mesh geometries where the flow field is 
interpolated across the shared
interface. 
# not appropriate, non-conformal mesh for sliding mesh

Francois et al. [88] found that both methods give similar results 
but the sliding mesh scheme required much less memory and was slightly quicker. (2.7 sliding mesh, Andrew, thesis)

Two-equation turbulence models allow the determination of both, a turbulent length and time scale
by solving two separate transport equations. The standard - model in ANSYS Fluent falls within this
class of models and has become the workhorse of practical engineering flow calculations in the time
since it was proposed by Launder and Spalding [fn:245] (p. 772). Robustness, economy, and reasonable
accuracy for a wide range of turbulent flows explain its popularity in industrial flow and heat transfer
simulations. It is a semi-empirical model, and the derivation of the model equations relies on 
phenomenological considerations and empiricism.

This is not telling you that you don't own the computer on which the folder exists. It's telling you that you don't own the folder. This is a very different concept of ownership.

On your Ubuntu system, your user account doesn't automatically have the ability to perform any possible action--some administrative actions can only be performed by root, the superuser. However, this user is not any real person and, in Ubuntu, you don't log in as this user. Instead, Ubuntu provides facilities like sudo and gksu to perform actions as root.

You should check out the three links above. Once you've read that, if you still want to change the permissions on that folder, here's one way to do it:

    Press Alt+F2.

    Type in the command gksu nautilus and press Enter.

    Now you have a file browser window running as root. You can change the permissions with this. Any program you open from this will run as root too. You should use this carefully and sparingly.

    Make sure to close this root Nautilus window when you're done, so you don't accidentally use it for something that you don't need to be root to do.

Before you change the permissions (and/or ownership) on this folder, you should be aware that doing this to system files in Ubuntu can have negative consequences: you can make your system insecure...or even stop your system from working.

** Shear Layer vs Boundary Layer vs Mixing layer
shear layer != Boundary layer
- Shear Layer :: reagion where there is a shear force (shear stress) (velocity gradient exists)

when two parallel streams of fluids meet at an interface with a velocity difference a shear layer is formed. By defination a shear layer is a layer of flow where a shear or velocity gradient exists. Going by this, boundary layer is also a form of shear layer. But in boundary layer the momentum transport is affected by a solid interface and viscous forces are dominant upto some distance. In case of a shear layer forming at a parallel fluid flow interface the viscous forces are not dominant and the flow is dominated by turbulent transport of momentum. This layer is sometimes called mixing layer also. But some authors call this fluid interface shear layer as mixing layer when the mixing of two species is involved, e.g., mixing of two parallel streams of two different gases at different velocities. 
In general a mixing layer is what is commonly called a "free shear layer". The mixing aspect arises because of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which causes it to wrap up into the so-called cats-eyes structures.

The reason the converse is not generally the case is that boundary layers (especially with separation) are layers with strong shear and can be called (and in the case with separation are) shear layers; i.e. there are significant boundary effects which are not present in the free shear layer case.

** [[https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Inserting_Images#Captions][Generating high-res and low-res images ]]
This is accomplished by

-    Not specifying the ~file extension~ (.eps, .pdf)  in the ~\includegraphics~ command, and
-   Specifying the desired extension in the ~preamble~. 
Thus, if we have two versions of an image, ~image.pdf~ (high-resolution) and ~image.png~ (low-resolution), 
then low resolution version:

 ~\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png,.pdf}~
To use high resolution images:
~\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.png}~

The command above will ensure that if two files are encountered with the same base name but different extensions 
(for example ~image.pdf~ and ~image.png~), then the ~.png~ version will be used first, and in its absence the .pdf version will be used,
 this is also a good ideas if some low-resolution versions are not available.
** Relate your results with previous findings from literature
When analysis your results, you need to compare your results with experimental data
or similar research, check whether similar trends are presents
- Normally refer to other's work on ~results&discussion~ section
the following components may be included:
- background information
- statement of results
- refer to previous research (justificiation/support, comparison)
- explanation of unexpected results
- recommendations/conclusions

Reasons for referring to the previous work:
- Comparing your results with those reported previously. This allows you to show
how your findings reflect, contradict or extend previous research.
- If you are generalising from your findings, you can use the existing
literature to supoort the deductions or hypotheses arising from your results.

an introduction to spectral anslysis, J. N. Rayner
what is spectrum?
- spectrum :: (general) the separation of colors in white light
- spectrum :: the characterics of any phenomenon when those characteristics are ordered according to 
increasing or decreasing wavelength. (J. N. Rayer 1971)[fn:rayner1971introduction]
- spectrum may be considered as the scale breakdown of a phenomenon in *space* or *time*.
- spectrum ansysis :: the process of calculating and interpreting a spectrum

spectrum is closed related with wavelength
            > spectrum ~ wavelength

*types of spectrum:*
- discrete spectrum
- continuous spectrum
(fig.1.2.2 Rayner 1971)

*Fourier analysis*
- any function of a real variable can be represented as the sum of sines and cosines
- Fourier analysis :: the process of fitting Fourier Series to data and of calcuating the amplitudes and phase angles of various waves

*trigononetric functions*
- the trigononetirc functions may be produced by the rotation of a vector of length ,V, around the the origin

** Newtonian Fluids and the Navier–Stokes Equations
in this chapter introduces constitutive equations
- constitutive equations :: the equations that relate the stress to the deformation
and thoes that relate the heat flux to the temperature.

i.e. stress ~ deformation
heat flux ~ temperature

Examples of *linear* equations: 
- Newton's viscosity law (Newton)
- Fourier's law
- Newton's viscosity law :: the /stress/ is proportional to the /rate of strain/.
- Fourier's law :: the /heat flux/ is proportional to the /temperature gradient/.

Note:
- there is no mathematical proof of physical laws. 
- Phycical laws are not proved, they are supported by empirical evidence.

Navier-Stokes equations (George S Stoke, English, 1819-1903; C. L. M. H. Navier ,French engineer, 1785–1836)

Newtonian fluid:
At ordinary pressures and temperatures all gases
obey these relations, as do many simple liquids. 

non-Newtonina fluid:
Liquids made up of complex molecules,
liquid mixtures, and slurries of fine particles in a liquid (including blood) do not obey
linear relations and are said to be non-Newtonian.

** Turbulence Length Scale for Turbulence Models
The mixing length is typically the size of the shear layer making the turbulence.  For a jet, or mixing layer, or wake, it is the half-width of the jet or mixing layer or wake.  This means that the mixing length varies as you go along (streamwise) the jet,layer,wake.  But does not vary across it.    
Similarity analysis (math) or experiments tell you how fast the jet/layer/wake size will grow as a function of the distance downstream.  Note that axisymmetric jets/wakes grow at different rates than planar ones.
A boundary layer is slightly different.  The mixing length is "the distance to the wall".

** Characteristic length scale
- for a channel 
the  charactersitic length-scale is the hydraulic radius, R_h = wh/P
+ P: the wetted perimeter
+ w: width of a channel
+ h: the depth of a channel
For an open channel, P= 2h+w
For a closed conduit, P = 2(h+w)

A rule of thumb, open channel is laminar if Re =UR_h/\nu < 500

Sort same-level entries. When there is an *active region*, all entries in the region
will be sorted. Otherwise *the children of the current headline* are sorted. The
command prompts for the sorting method, which can be alphabetically, numerically,
by time (first timestamp with active preferred, creation time, scheduled
time, deadline time), by priority, by TODO keyword (in the sequence the keywords
have been defined in the setup) or by the value of a property. Reverse
sorting is possible as well. You can also supply your own function to extract
the sorting key. With a C-u prefix, sorting will be case-sensitive

** Vorticity
- Vorticity :: a vector, \omega,  twice the angular velocity, \( \omega = \nabla \times v \)

- physical meaning:
   + vorticity meansures the *solid body like rotation* of a material point, p', that neighbors the primary maetrial point, p (panton)

\( \nabla \cdot \omega = 0 \): vorticity is divergence free
\nabla \times \nabla \phi =0

- the existence of vorticity indicates that viscous effects are important

why does fluid particles rotate?
it due to unbalanced shear stress
cause  du/dy =\= 0

- Vorticity dynamics, roughly speaking, offers a method to separate a flow into viscous and 
inviscid effects.

https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_difference_between_a_vortex_and_an_eddy2

As far as I know, there is actually no difference between a vortex and an eddy. 
However, the words are used in different contexts:
In turbulence you usually speak of eddies and these eddies decay to smaller eddies and so forth which forms a turbulent cascade. This has nothing to do with the type of fluid. Eddies are formed in fluids, gas and plasma.
Vortices on the other hand are more stable structures and the description of their physics (e.g. geostrophic winds) do not necessarily include turbulence, i.e. you don't expext them to decay and form a turbulent cascade.
To make a flow turbulent, you need to inject energy into it. If you have a laminar flow without an obstacle and without friction, there are no forces acting on the fluid. You could Galileo-transform into the moving fluid frame and see that there's nothing happening. Therefore, you don't generate eddies and you don't have turbulence.
If you place an obstacle in the flow, it is equivalent to an injection of energy on a scale comparable to the size of the obstacle. Behind the obstacle you will see that eddies are formed. These eddies will then in turn decay to smaller and smaller eddies, i.e. you have a turbulent cascade.

Why is it so important to make a distinction between rotational and irrotational
flows?
irrotational flow is easier to analysis
outside the BL, the flow is frequently irrotational

** Criterion for laminar or Turbulent flow

** Limits of steady BEM
One primary assumption is that
the calculations are static; it is assumed that the airflow field around the airfoil is always in
equilibrium and that the passing flow accelerates instantaneously to adjust to the changes in the
vorticity in the wake. In practice, it has been shown that the airfoil response takes time to adjust
to a changing wake resulting from new inflow or turbine operating conditions (Snel and Schepers
1995). In order to model this time lag effect correctly, we recommended that the user utilize the
generalized dynamic wake model described below.


breaks down when the blades experience
large deflections out of the rotor plane

- forces acting on the blade element are essentially two-dimensional, meaning that spanwise flow is neglected, thus less accurate for heavily loaded rotors with large pressure
gradients across the span

 With Emacs, org mode and org-babel, it’s possible to evaluate source code samples embedded in your org files
 and have the output of said evaluation appear inline. 

This makes for a beautiful literate programming environment. 
It also enables one to include graphs in one’s documents (org mode, PDF, HTML presentations or blog posts) by using for example GraphViz.



First follow the org-babel documentation and enable source code evaluation for dot by adding the following to your Emacs init.el:

(org-babel-do-load-languages
‘org-babel-load-languages
‘((dot . t)))

Then create a new document, and add something like the following dot source code sample to it:

I think this problem is caused by the change of ~org-babel-check-confirm-evaluate~ from a macro to a function. 
If you have org-mode (and thus the old macro) loaded when you compile the new code, it sees the old macro instead of the new function.

As others have pointed out uninstalling org-mode restarting Emacs (without loading org-mode) and reinstalling will fix the problem. 
You can also delete the compiled .elc files and recompile with byte-recompile-directory.

** Do we need to check the y+ values for SST K- \omega turbulence model during post processing and if yes, should the y+ value be `1’ everywhere on the wall?
In SST k omega model the flow is resolved up to the wall.
 For this the y+ =1. However, in some cases where the solution is converged and showing fairly good results, the y+ values are different. 
Can this be treated as an acceptable solution?

answer:
- depend on how the near wall turbulence model is implemented in the solver/code 
- The original *two layer zonal model* developed by Chen and used in the earlier versions of Fluent and Star-CCM required y+<=1.0.
- Currently, the *two layer model* is normally implemented as an *enhanced wall treatment* 
where the solver/code automatically employs the two layer model, the law of the wall, or a blending function of the two.
 This approach is more forgiving in terms of y+, but you still need y+<1 if you want/need to capture the laminar sub-layer.
- Finally, If your model is able to replicate the experiments, it does not mean that you do not need to check y+. 
 If you get values of y+>1 it means that your mesh is not fine enough 
but it also means that to capture the flow physics of the experiments you are replicating, modeling the laminar sub-layer might not be needed.

- the outflow information is extrapolated from the interior

*** limits:
- Poor rate of convergence when backflow occurs during iterations.
- Cannot be used if backflow is expected in the final solution

- if the flow may produce a recirculation
 at the outlet
or if the flow field is not stable and fully developed at the outlet, then a pressure outlet
boundary condition is preferred.

** Pressure Interpolation Schemes
- linear 
- Standard
- Second Order (default)

- The Linear scheme computes the face pressure as the average of the pressure values in the adjacent cells.

- The Standard scheme interpolates the pressure values at the faces using momentum equation coefficients
  + works well as long as the pressure variation between cell centers is smooth

  + not good for flows with large *body forces*, such as in strongly swirling flows, in high-Rayleigh-number natural convection and the like.

- The *Second Order* scheme reconstructs the face pressure using a central differencing scheme

*Second order* scheme *may* provide improved accuracy over the *Standard* and *Linear* schemes.
 The Second Order scheme is not applicable for the VOF or mixture model for multiphase flow.


** Warped-Face Gradient Correction


improves the gradient accuracy for meshes containing *high aspect ratios*, cells with non-flat faces, and highly deformed cells. By default, the fast, or more computationally efficient mode of the warped-face gradient correction is used.

26. Is ours the only universe?
A number of quantum theorists and cosmologists are tryingto figure out whether our universe is part of a bigger "multiverse."But others suspect that this hard-to-test idea may be a question forphilosophers.
27. What drove cosmic inflation?
In the first moments after the big bang, the universeblew up at an incredible rate. But what did the blowing? Measurements of thecosmic microwave background and other astrophysical observations are narrowingthe possibilities.
28. When and how did the first stars andgalaxies form?
The broad brush strokes are visible, but the fine detailsaren't. Data from satellites and ground-based telescopes may soon helppinpoint, among other particulars, when the first generation of stars burnedoff the hydrogen "fog" that filled the universe.
29. Where do ultrahigh-energy cosmic rayscome from?
Above a certain energy, cosmic rays don't travel very farbefore being destroyed. So why are cosmic-ray hunters spotting such rays withno obvious source within our galaxy?
30. What powers quasars?

31. What is the nature of black holes?
Relativistic mass crammed into a quantum-sized object? It's a recipe fordisaster—and scientists are still trying to figure out the ingredients.
32. Why is there more matter than antimatter?
To a particle physicist, matter and antimatter are almost the same. Somesubtle difference must explain why matter is common and antimatter rare.
33. Does the proton decay?
In a theory of everything, quarks (which make up protons) should somehowbe convertible to leptons (such as electrons)--so catching a proton decayinginto something else might reveal new laws of particle physics.
34. What is the nature of gravity?
It clashes with quantum theory. It doesn't fit in the Standard Model.Nobody has spotted the particle that is responsible for it. Newton's apple contained a whole can ofworms.
35. Why is time different from other dimensions?
It took millennia for scientists to realize that time is a dimension, likethe three spatial dimensions, and that time and space are inextricably linked.The equations make sense, but they don't satisfy those who ask why we perceivea "now" or why time seems to flow the way it does.
36. Are there smaller building blocks than quarks?
Atoms were "uncuttable." Then scientists discovered protons,neutrons, and other subatomic particles--which were, in turn, shown to be madeup of quarks and gluons. Is there something more fundamental still?
37. Are neutrinos their own antiparticles?
Nobody knows this basic fact about neutrinos, although a number ofunderground experiments are under way. Answering this question may be a crucialstep to understanding the origin of matter in the universe.
38. Is there a unified theory explaining all correlatedelectron systems?
High-temperature superconductors and materials with giant and colossalmagnetoresistance are all governed by the collective rather than individualbehaviour of electrons. There is currently no common framework for understandingthem.
39. What is the most powerful laser researchers canbuild?
Theorists say an intense enough laser field would rip photons intoelectron-positron pairs, dousing the beam. But no one knows whether it'spossible to reach that point.
40. Can researchers make a perfect optical lens?
They've done it with microwaves but never with visible light.
41. Is it possible to create magnetic semiconductors thatwork at room temperature?
Such devices have been demonstrated at low temperatures but not yet in arange warm enough for spintronics applications.
42. What is the pairing mechanism behind high-temperaturesuperconductivity?
Electrons in superconductors surf together in pairs. After 2 decades ofintense study, no one knows what holds them together in the complex,high-temperature materials.
43. Can we develop a general theory of the dynamics ofturbulent flows and the motion of granular materials?
So far, such "non-equilibrium systems" defy the tool kit ofstatistical mechanics, and the failure leaves a gaping hole in physics.
44. Are there stable high-atomic-number elements?
A super heavy-element with 184 neutrons and 114 protons should berelatively stable, if physicists can create it.
45. Is super-fluidity possible in a solid? If so, how?
Despite hints in solid helium, nobody is sure whether a crystallinematerial can flow without resistance. If new types of experiments show thatsuch outlandish behaviour is possible, theorists would have to explain how.
46. What is the structure of water?
Researchers continue to tussle over how many bonds each H2O molecule makeswith its nearest neighbours.
47. What is the nature of the glassy state?
Molecules in a glass are arranged much like those in liquids but are moretightly packed. Where and why does liquid end and glass begin?
48. Are there limits to rational chemical synthesis?
The larger synthetic molecules get, the harder it is to control theirshapes and make enough copies of them to be useful. Chemists will need newtools to keep their creations growing.
49. What is the ultimate efficiency of photovoltaiccells?
Conventional solar cells top out at converting 32% of the energy insunlight to electricity. Can researchers break through the barrier?
50. Will fusion always be the energy source of thefuture?
It's been 35 years away for about 50 years, and unless the internationalcommunity gets its act together, it'll be 35 years away for many decades tocome.
51. What drives the solar magnetic cycle?
Scientists believe differing rates of rotation from place to place on thesun underlie its 22-year sunspot cycle. They just can't make it work in theirsimulations. Either a detail is askew, or it's back to the drawing board.
52. How do planets form?
How bits of dust and ice and gobs of gas came together to form the planetswithout the sun devouring them all is still unclear. Planetary systems aroundother stars should provide clues.
53. What causes ice ages?
Something about the way the planet tilts, wobbles, and careens around thesun presumably brings on ice ages every 100,000 years or so, but reams ofclimate records haven't explained exactly how.
54. What causes reversals in Earth's magnetic field?
Computer models and laboratory experiments are generating new data on howEarth's magnetic poles might flip-flop. The trick will be matching simulationsto enough aspects of the magnetic field beyond the inaccessible core to build aconvincing case.
55. Are there earthquake precursors that can lead touseful predictions?
Prospects for finding signs of an imminent quake have been waning sincethe 1970s. Understanding faults will progress, but routine prediction wouldrequire an as-yet-unimagined breakthrough.
56. Is there--or was there--life elsewhere in the solarsystem?
The search for life--past or present--on other planetarybodies now drives NASA's planetary exploration program, which focuses on Mars,where water abounded when life might have first arisen.
57. What is the origin ofhomochirality in nature?
Most bio-molecules can be synthesized in mirror-imageshapes. Yet in organisms, amino acids are always left-handed, and sugars arealways right-handed. The origins of this preference remain a mystery.
58. Can we predict howproteins will fold?
Out of a near infinitude of possible ways to fold, aprotein picks one in just tens of microseconds. The same task takes 30 years ofcomputer time.
59. How many proteinsare there in humans?
It has been hard enough counting genes. Proteins can bespliced in different ways and decorated with numerous functional groups, all ofwhich makes counting their numbers impossible for now.
60. How do proteins findtheir partners?
Protein-protein interactions are at the heart of life. Tounderstand how partners come together in precise orientations in seconds,researchers need to know more about the cell's biochemistry and structuralorganization.
61. How many forms of celldeath are there?
In the 1970s, apoptosis was finally recognized asdistinct from necrosis. Some biologists now argue that the cell death story iseven more complicated. Identifying new ways cells die could lead to bettertreatments for cancer and degenerative diseases.
62. What keepsintracellular traffic running smoothly?
Membranes inside cells transport key nutrients around,and through, various cell compartments without sticking to each other or losingtheir way. Insights into how membranes stay on track could help conquerdiseases, such as cystic fibrosis.
63. What enables cellularcomponents to copy themselves independent of DNA?
Centrosomes, which help pull apart paired chromosomes,and other organelles replicate on their own time, without DNA's guidance. Thisindependence still defies explanation.
64. What roles dodifferent forms of RNA play in genome function?
RNA is turning out to play a dizzying assortment ofroles, from potentially passing genetic information to offspring to muting geneexpression. Scientists are scrambling to decipher this versatile molecule.
65. What role do telomeresand centromeres play in genome function?
These chromosome features will remain mysteries until newtechnologies can sequence them.
66. Why are some genomesreally big and others quite compact?
The puffer fish genome is 400 million bases; onelungfish's is 133 billion bases long. Repetitive and duplicated DNA don'texplain why this and other size differences exist.
67. What is all that"junk" doing in our genomes?
DNA between genes is proving important for genomefunction and the evolution of new species. Comparative sequencing, micro-arraystudies, and lab work are helping genomicists find a multitude of genetic gemsamid the junk.
68. How much will new technologies lower thecost of sequencing?
New tools and conceptual breakthroughs are driving thecost of DNA sequencing down by orders of magnitude. The reductions are enablingresearch from personalized medicine to evolutionary biology to thrive.
69. How do organs andwhole organisms know when to stop growing?
A person's right and left legs almost always end up thesame length, and the hearts of mice and elephants each fit the proper rib cage.How genes set limits on cell size and number continues to mystify.
70. How can genomechanges other than mutations be inherited?
Researchers are finding ever more examples of thisprocess, called epigenetics, but they can't explain what causes and preservesthe changes.
71. How is asymmetry determined in theembryo?
Whirling cilia help an embryo tell its left from itsright, but scientists are still looking for the first factors that give arelatively uniform ball of cells a head, tail, front, and back.
72. How do limbs, fins, and faces develop andevolve?
The genes that determine the length of a nose or thebreadth of a wing are subject to natural and sexual selection. Understandinghow selection works could lead to new ideas about the mechanics of evolutionwith respect to development.
73. What triggers puberty?
Nutrition--including that received in utero--seems tohelp set this mysterious biological clock, but no one knows exactly what forceschildhood to end.
74. Are stem cells at theheart of all cancers?
The most aggressive cancer cells look a lot like stemcells. If cancers are caused by stem cells gone awry, studies of a cell's"stemness" may lead to tools that could catch tumours sooner anddestroy them more effectively.
75. Is cancer susceptibleto immune control?
Although our immune responses can suppress tumour growth,tumour cells can combat those responses with counter-measures. This defence canstymie researchers hoping to develop immune therapies against cancer.
76. Can cancers becontrolled rather than cured?
Drugs that cut off a tumour’s fuel supplies--say, bystopping blood-vessel growth—can safely check or even reverse tumour growth.But how long the drugs remain effective is still unknown.
77. Is inflammation amajor factor in all chronic diseases?
It's a driver of arthritis, but cancer and heart disease?More and more, the answer seems to be yes, and the question remains why andhow.
78. How do prion diseases work?
Even if one accepts that prions are just mis-foldedproteins, many mysteries remain. How can they go from the gut to the brain, andhow do they kill cells once there, for example.
79. How much dovertebrates depend on the innate immune system to fight infection?
This system predates the vertebrate adaptive immuneresponse. Its relative importance is unclear, but immunologists are working tofind out.
80. Does immunologicmemory require chronic exposure to antigens?
Yes, say a few prominent thinkers, but experiments withmice now challenge the theory. Putting the debate to rest would require provingthat something is not there, so the question likely will not go away.
81. Why doesn't a pregnantwoman reject her fetus?
Recent evidence suggests that the mother's immune systemdoesn't "realize" that the fetus is foreign even though it gets halfits genes from the father. Yet just as Nobelist Peter Medawar said when hefirst raised this question in 1952, "the verdict has yet to be returned."
82. What synchronizes an organism's circadianclocks?
Circadian clock genes have popped up in all types ofcreatures and in many parts of the body. Now the challenge is figuring out howall the gears fit together and what keeps the clocks set to the same time.
83. How do migrating organisms find theirway?
Birds, butterflies, and whales make annual journeys ofthousands of kilometres. They rely on cues such as stars and magnetic fields,but the details remain unclear.
84. Why do we sleep?
A sound slumber may refresh muscles and organs or keepanimals safe from dangers lurking in the dark. But the real secret of sleepprobably resides in the brain, which is anything but still while we're snoringaway.
85. Why do we dream?
Freud thought dreaming provides an outlet for ourunconscious desires. Now, neuroscientists suspect that brain activity duringREM sleep--when dreams occur--is crucial for learning. Is the experience ofdreaming just a side effect?
86. Why are there criticalperiods for language learning?
Monitoring brain activity in young children--includinginfants--may shed light on why children pick up languages with ease whileadults often struggle to learn train station basics in a foreign tongue.
87. Do pheromones influence human behaviour?
Many animals use airborne chemicals to communicate,particularly when mating. Controversial studies have hinted that humans too usepheromones. Identifying them will be the key to assessing their sway on oursocial lives.
88. How do general anesthetics work?
Scientists are chipping away at the drugs' effects onindividual neurons, but understanding how they render us unconscious will be atougher nut to crack.
89. What causesschizophrenia?
Researchers are trying to track down genes involved inthis disorder. Clues may also come from research on traits schizophrenics sharewith normal people.
90. What causes autism?
Many genes probably contribute to this baffling disorder,as well as unknown environmental factors. A biomarker for early diagnosis wouldhelp improve existing therapy, but a cure is a distant hope.
91. To what extent can westave off Alzheimer's?
A 5- to 10-year delay in this late-onset disease wouldimprove old age for millions. Researchers are determining whether treatmentswith hormones or antioxidants, or mental and physical exercise, will help.
92. What is the biologicalbasis of addiction?
Addiction involves the disruption of the brain's rewardcircuitry. But personality traits such as impulsivity and sensation-seekingalso play a part in this complex behaviour.
93. Is morality hardwiredinto the brain?
That question has long puzzled philosophers; now someneuroscientists think brain imaging will reveal circuits involved in reasoning.
94. What are the limits of learning bymachines?
Computers can already beat the world's best chessplayers, and they have a wealth of information on the Web to draw on. Butabstract reasoning is still beyond any machine.
95. How much ofpersonality is genetic?
Aspects of personality are influenced by genes;environment modifies the genetic effects. The relative contributions remainunder debate.
96. What is the biologicalroot of sexual orientation?
Much of the "environmental" contribution tohomosexuality may occur before birth in the form of prenatal hormones, soanswering this question will require more than just the hunt for "gaygenes."
97. Will there ever be a tree of life thatsystematists can agree on?
Despite better morphological, molecular, and statisticalmethods, researchers' trees don't agree. Expect greater, but not complete,consensus.
98. How many species are there on Earth?
Count all the stars in the sky? Impossible. Count all thespecies on Earth? Ditto. But the biodiversity crisis demands that we try.
99. What is a species?
A "simple" concept that's been muddied byevolutionary data; a clear definition may be a long time in coming.
100. Why does lateral transfer occur in somany species and how?
Once considered rare, gene swapping, particularly amongmicrobes, is proving quite common. But why and how genes are so mobile--and theeffect on fitness--remains to be determined.
101. Who was LUCA (the last universal commonancestor)?
Ideas about the origin of the 1.5-billion-year-old"mother" of all complex organisms abound. The continued discovery ofprimitive microbes, along with comparative genomics, should help resolve life'sdeep past.
102. How did flowers evolve?
Darwin calledthis question an "abominable mystery." Flowers arose in the cycadsand conifers, but the details of their evolution remain obscure.
103. How do plants make cell walls?
Cellulose and pectin walls surround cells, keeping waterin and supporting tall trees. The biochemistry holds the secrets to turning itsbiomass into fuel.
104. How is plant growth controlled?
Redwoods grow to be hundreds of meters tall, Arcticwillows barely 10 centimetres. Understanding the difference could lead tohigher-yielding crops.
105. Why aren't all plants immune to alldiseases?
Plants can mount a general immune response, but they alsomaintain molecular snipers that take out specific pathogens. Plant pathologistsare asking why different species, even closely related ones, have differentsets of defenders. The answer could result in hardier crops.
106. What is the basis of variation in stresstolerance in plants?
We need crops that better withstand drought, cold, andother stresses. But there are so many genes involved, in complex interactions,which no one has yet figured out which ones work how.
107. What caused mass extinctions?
A huge impact did in the dinosaurs, but the search forother catastrophic triggers of extinction has had no luck so far. If moresubtle or stealthy culprits are to blame, they will take considerably longer tofind.
108. Can we prevent extinction?
Finding cost-effective and politically feasible ways tosave many endangered species requires creative thinking.
109. Why were some dinosaurs so large?
Dinosaurs reached almost unimaginable sizes, some in lessthan 20 years. But how did the long-necked sauropods, for instance, eat enoughto pack on up to 100 tons without denuding their world?
110. How will ecosystems respond to globalwarming?
To anticipate the effects of the intensifying greenhouse,climate modellers will have to focus on regional changes and ecologists on theright combination of environmental changes.
111. How many kinds of humans coexisted inthe recent past, and how did they relate?
The new dwarf human species fossil from Indonesiasuggests that at least four kinds of humans thrived in the past 100,000 years.Better dates and additional material will help confirm or revise this picture.
112. What gave rise tomodern human behaviour?
Did Homo sapiens acquire abstract thought, language, andart gradually or in a cultural "big bang," which in Europeoccurred about 40,000 years ago? Data from Africa,where our species arose, may hold the key to the answer.
113. What are the roots ofhuman culture?
No animal comes close to having humans' ability to buildon previous discoveries and pass the improvements on. What determines thosedifferences could help us understand how human culture evolved.
114. What are theevolutionary roots of language and music?
Neuroscientists exploring how we speak and make music arejust beginning to find clues as to how these prized abilities arose.
115. What are human races,and how did they develop?
Anthropologists have long argued that race lacks biologicalreality. But our genetic makeup does vary with geographic origin and as suchraises political and ethical as well as scientific questions.
116. Why do some countries grow and othersstagnate?
From Norwayto Nigeria,living standards across countries vary enormously, and they're not becomingmore equal.
117. What impact do large government deficitshave on a country's interest rates and economic growth rate?
The United  States could provide a test case.
118. Are political and economic freedomclosely tied?
China mayprovide one answer.
119. Why has poverty increased and lifeexpectancy declined in sub-Saharan Africa?
Almost all efforts to reduce poverty in sub-Saharan Africahave failed. Figuring out what will work is crucial to alleviating massive humansuffering.
Seven outstanding mathematics problems
可获：菲尔茨（Fields）奖----数学界的诺贝尔奖
(Selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute, the seventh problem isdiscussed on 19thproblem. For more details, go towww.claymath.org/millennium)
120. Is there a simple test for determining whether anelliptic curve has an infinite number of rational solutions?
Equations of the form y2 = x3 ax b are powerful mathematical tools. TheBirch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture tells how to determine how many solutionsthey have in the realm of rational numbers--information that could solve a hostof problems, if the conjecture is true.
121. Can a Hodge cycle be written as a sum of algebraiccycles?
Two useful mathematical structures arose independently in geometry and inabstract algebra. The Hodge conjecture posits a surprising link between them,but the bridge remains to be built.
122. Will mathematicians unleash the power of theNavier-Stokes equations?
First written down in the 1840s, the equations hold the keys tounderstanding both smooth and turbulent flow. To harness them, though,theorists must find out exactly when they work and under what conditions theybreak down.
123. Does Poincaré's test identify spheres infour-dimensional space?
You can tie a string around a doughnut, but it will slide right off asphere. The mathematical principle behind that observation can reliably spotevery sphere-like object in 3D space. Henri Poincaré conjectured that it shouldalso work in the next dimension up, but no one has proved it yet.
124. Do mathematically interesting zero-value solutionsof the Riemann zeta function all have the form a + bi?
Don't sweat the details. Since the mid-19th century, the "Riemannhypothesis" has been the monster catfish in mathematicians' pond. If true,it will give them a wealth of information about the distribution of primenumbers and other long-standing mysteries.
125. Does the Standard Model of particle physics rest onsolid mathematical foundations?
For almost 50 years, the model has rested on "quantum Yang-Millstheory," which links the behaviour of particles to structures found ingeometry. The theory is breathtakingly elegant and useful--but no one hasproved that it's sound.

The tidal marine turbine configuration is not as of the wind turbine. 
In the wind turbine both front and rear rotors are placed to maximise power from the wind coming always from one direction. 
In tidal marine turbine the front and rear rotors are placed to maximise power from the tide that alternates its direction.

In other words, in our tidal marine turbine the front and rear rotors are *opposite mirrors*. This is not the case in the wind turbine.

In *transient* simulation, for example, modeling *a wave motion with VOF model* or concentration front

*** Pseudo-Transient Method
- Goal: to obtain solutions faster and more robustly, especially for highly *anisotropic meshes*

- the overall initialization time using this approach is much longer than that using standard initialization by zone, but it allows a much quicker solve
- particularly suited to turbomachinery as well as external and compressible flow problems

** high residuals in Fluent
description:
max residuals is 1e-2, how to  reduce scaled residuals

*Answer:*
- Residuals are just a mean to compare how does the actual solution differ from the previous one.
- If you have provided a very good initial guess, the residuals may not drop three orders of magnitude.
- If the variable of interest is nearly zero everywhere, the residuals may not drop three orders of magnitude. In fully-developed flow in a pipe, for example, the cross-sectional velocities are zero. If these velocities have been initialized to zero, initial (and final) residuals are both close to zero, and a three-order drop cannot be expected.

A first indication of the convergence of the solution to *steady-state* is the reduction in the residuals. 
Experience shows, however, that different types of flows require different levels of residual reduction. 

For example, it is found regularly that *swirling flows* can exhibit significant changes 
even if the residuals are reduced by more than 4 - 6 orders of magnitude. 

Other flows are well converged with a reduction of only 2 - 4 orders.

Please refer to the paragraph “28.21.1. Judging Convergence “ in the Fluent User’s Guide which discuss 
influence of *initialization* on the residual levels. 

I would like to introduce following points which might be helpful for you:

1. I generally start with checking my initial/boundary conditions, fluid properties 
and computational grid whether all of them are well posed or not. 

Your grid metrics are reasonable but by far not optimal. So you need to accept this hurdle.

2. In Fluent I usually use the *coupled solver* with option *pseudo-transient* 
where I can set up a global time scale for all cells in the domain an have the possibility to reduce some explicit under relaxation factors. 
The same is true for all other solver but here I would not recommend to reduce the implicit *energy* URF to a value smaller than 0.95.

3.You have to consider the whole residual behavior and to decide whether it is better to consider a *transient* run. 
A good indication of switching to a unsteady solver is if you see that changing the time scale or URF’s does not really 
influence *the frequency of the residual oscillations*.

4. In addition to the residual reduction, it is therefore required to /monitor the solution/ during convergence 
and to plot the user-defined target quantities of the simulation as a function of the residual (or the iteration number). 

A visual observation of the solution at different levels of convergence is recommended. 

4.1. I recommend that you monitor the global balances of *conserved variables*, such as mass, momentum and energy, vs. the iteration number.
4.2. Report *global mass balance* and heat balance if energy equation is activated (Flux>Report)
4.3. Plot and Report *target variables* as a function of iteration number (Report Definitions based on surface average or volume averaged).

Global imbalances as well reporting key parameters are  more important than just sticking to the overall level of residuals. 


5. save the residuals for post processing (in TUI solver/set/expert ) and 
then to scrutinize the areas where the maximum values of the unscaled residuals are happening 
and to find out whether they are related to a local issue such as *poorly meshed regions* (poor metrics or low resolution), 
domain interface, local abrupt physic change (shock), etc. or to a global effect. 

These global effects might be related to a to *high non-physical turbulence level* leading to the so called 
thin solution favoring transient effects or 
to a *too-low non-physical turbulence level* leading to intermittent Pressure changes (thick solution). 

a larger time scale on the beginning is required to avoid transient effects holding up convergence 
(starting with higher time scale and then using a smaller one until convergence).


Altering URF’s could enhance the convergence behavior but slow up the iterative process. 
That is why please be cautious with adjusting URF’s and do not alter the implicit energy URF too much.

- blockage ratio :: the ratio of rotor swept area to cross section area of  channel
\[
\epsilon = A_t/A
\]

where A_t is the turbine swept area, and A is the channel cross-sectional area

When \( \epsilon < 0.05 \), the flow is regarded as unconfined ([fn:Whelan2009] 

- Solid Blockage :: the ratio of "frontal area" of an test object to the stream cross-sectional area
- usyally chosen in the range of 0.01-0.10 with 0.05 being typical[fn:barlow1999]

- apect ratio (AR) (aeronautics) :: the ratio of its span to its mean chord

- wake blockage :: \(\epsilon_{\omega b}\) , 
- In a close test section, the wake blockage increases the measured *drag*.
- In a open test section, wake blockage is negligible cause the airstream is free to expand.


- Solidity :: \sigma = Nc/R
where N is the number of blades and c is the blade chordlength

Blockage is not included in blade design stage (Schluntz, 2015)

In blocked conditions, the Cp of a rotor may be higher than Betz limit[fn:Garret2007].

Rotors designed to operate in high local blockage require greater solidity and lower blade twist than rotors designed for operation in unblocked flow.(Schluntz, 2015)

3D URANS blockage effect on horozontal axial-flow and vertical axis flow turbines
- Cp, Ct increase linearly with blockage
- The difference between lateral and vertical confinements plays a secondary role with little effect unless the confinement
asymmetry (CA) becomes greater than approximately 3
- If the turbine is operated at a small tip-speed ratio relative to the
optimal point, dynamic stall is likely to appear due to the increased
angle-of-attack. In such a case, the performance of the turbine
(especially the power coefficient) becomes almost insensitive to the
blockage ratio.

- the influence of the free surface on the turbine performance is assumed small compared to the influence of channel blockage [10,18,20],

Reason: wind shear, yaw, tilt misalignment, tower passage, atomospheric turbulence.

answer:
The message "Note: zone–surface: cannot create surface from sliding interface zone" appears when Fluent opens and reads the case and data files.

** Is inviscid flow assumption justifiable  if quantity of interest is power coefficient (integral quantity)?
From CFD result,  the viscous force/pressure force is pretty small, about 1%, thus the pressure force dorminates.
In inviscid flow, viscosity is ignored, and only pressure force, Thus inviscid flow is a good approximation if quantity of interest is power coefficient.

** export multiblock structured meshes (pointwise) to Fluent
ANSYS Fluent consider left-handed blocks invalid.
 Therefore, you should always evaluate the orientation of your grid prior to CAE export using the Orient command.

When creating multiblock structured meshes it is important that each block is oriented using a right-handed coordinate system.
use the Edit, Orient command to align the i, j, k component directions of your multiblock structured meshes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8xEtZwbg5M

 Left-handed blocks are not considered valid in ANSYS Fluent. So you may want to examine the orientation of your blocks using the Edit, Orient command before the blocks are exported.

** Grid Orientation before exportation

2D Domain Orientation, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZLpYuJCDZA
> edit/orientation
 The video describes how to orient 2-D domains in which you orient the i- and j- coordinate directions for one domain 
such that its resulting normal vector points in the positive z- coordinate direction. 
Then you can use the *Set Master* button to save this orientation,
 select the remaining structured domains, and align them using the same orientation as the master. 
This same procedure can be extended to 3-D blocks. Select your *blocks*, and from the Edit menu choose the Orient... option.
 Select a block, and align it's i-, j-, and k- coordinate directions while ensuring that the resulting block's orientation is *right-handed*.
 Typically aligning the coordinate directions with the positive x-, y-, and z- axes ensures this. 
You can swap the block's i-, j-, and k- directions as necessary using the buttons available in the Orient panel.
 You can also swap their direction. Once you have a single right-handed block, 
then you can use the same procedure to save its orientation as the master, 
select all of the block, and align the remaining blocks using the same orientation that was used in orienting the master block.﻿

** MRF
the MRF model is applicable when /the flow at the interface/ between adjacent moving/stationary zones is nearly uniform (“mixed out”). If the
flow at this interface is not uniform, the MRF model may not provide a physically meaningful solution.

** mixing plane model (MPM)
Flow-field data from adjacent zones are passed as boundary conditions that are *spatially averaged* or “mixed” at the mixing plane interface.
- steady 

You can think of MPM  as a set of SRF models for each blade passage coupled by boundary conditions supplied by the mixing plane model.
- the flow data at the mixing plane interface are averaged in the circumferential direction 

- “mixing plane pair” :: The coupling of an *upstream outlet* boundary zone with a *downstream inlet* boundary zone 
| Upstream        | Downstream      |
|-----------------+-----------------|
| pressure outlet | pressure inlet  |
| pressure outlet | velocity inlet  |
| pressure outlet | mass flow inlet |
> For specific instructions about setting up mixing planes, see Setting Up the Mixing Plane Model in the
User's Guide.

*** Choosing an Averaging Method
initiate the solution with area averaging, then switch to mass
averaging after reverse flow dies out.
- Mass averaging is not available with multiphase flows

** Single Versus Multiple Frame of Reference Modeling
Single component systems can usually be modeled by referring the
entire domain to a single moving reference frame >> steady state solution

If multiple components are required (e.g. additional blade rows,
volutes, baffles, struts, etc.), then a single frame of reference can
not be used! This leads to multiple zone models, where two or
more fluid zones are connected via *interfaces*

For multiple component systems, three different modeling
approaches are available, depending on *the level of interaction*
at the zone interface boundaries:
- Frozen Rotor Model :: >> steady-state solution
  + Ignore interaction effects at the interfaces 
- Mixing Plane Model :: >> steady-state solution
  + Ignore circumferential non-uniformities in the flow by averaging at the
interfaces 
- Sliding Mesh Model (Fluent) / Transient Rotor-Stator Model (CFX)  :: unsteady solution
  + The cells in rotating fluid zones are moved relative to adjacent stationary zones

** Machine learning

Abstract: At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), physicists need to process large amounts of data in short time. This is typically done with rule-based algorithms designed through domain knowledge, which can reach very large accuracy at the cost of big execution time. The emergence of Deep Learning as a tool to process raw data is opening new possibilities, both in terms of accuracy and latency. In this lecture, I will review a set of examples showing how Deep Learning could be used in typical event reconstruction problems at the LHC. Besides offering a cost-effective alternative to classic algorithms, Deep Learning offers the opportunity to explore new methods to probe the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model.

** A neural network approach to enhance blade element momentum theory performance for horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbine application
Highlights

    Artificial neural networks (NNs) overcomes the convergence issue that occurs during blade element momentum (BEM) iteration

    NNs were employed as multivariate interpolation tool to calculate the lift/drag coefficients which improved BEM accuracy

    Integrating the suggested BEM-NNs model into a modified BEM model to account for blockage in channels.
    The BEM-NNs model successfully overcame the convergence problem at high tip speed ratios compared to other modified models

To the authors’ best knowledge only two laboratory studies have been conducted 
on the influence of waves on the performance oftidal turbines. 
Barltrop et al. [10], used towing tank experimental data to 
verify that their BEM model combined with linear wave theory 
accurately describe time averaged measured turbine 
thrust and torque for a range of imposed regular waves 
with varying period and wave height. They used a three bladed horizontal axis turbine with a radius of 0.160 m and an S814 blade with a maximum chord of66.5 mm. The reported Reynolds number rangewas 1.4 ?104?4.0 ?104, based on the 70% blade radius, and the relative velocity based on the circumference at the 70% blade radius. An additional major finding in this study was the observation of significant variations of instantaneous thrust and torque magnitudes at the timescale ofthe wave period, and they point out that these variations can have significant impact on full scale rotor fatigue and sustainability

verified the controllers by numerical simulations and labscale
experiments.

small discrepancies are observed between the RANS and BEM results


They *documented* wake velocity profiles, including 

turbulent intensites in the wake of turbine arrays.

The objective of verifying a calculation is error estimation, that *is determining* the accuracy of a calculation

** email from eldad
Please see attached for my comments on the revised thesis.

Fig 5.18: You plotted the Park model with k=0.4 for both cases of TI. 
Okay for the thesis, 
but if you wish to improve the manuscript of that chapter that you sent me before the viva, 
you should also best fit the Park model to the RANS results. 
- Best fit means changing k until it best fits the RANS results.

Many modern plotting software has best fit options. 
for example in gnuplot the following script can be used to best fit the park model:

#+begin_src
# write the value of a which is u_inf*(1-sqrt(1-C_T))
a = .... 
#write the value of the diameter D
d = .....
f(x) = a*d*d/((d+2*k*x)*(d+2*k*x))
# res.dat is the file containing two columns of x, C_T 
fit f(x) via k
plot 'res.dat' with lines lw 1, f(x) lw 3 title "best fitted"
#+end_src

Further information can on best fit and least square operations can be found
 in many books as Numerical Recipes

** modern renewable energy
- biomass ::  plant or animal material used for energy production.
- traditional Biomass :: Solid biomass including fuel wood, charcoal,
agricultural and forest residues, and animal dung, that typically
is used in rural areas of developing countries with traditional
technologies such as open fires for cooking, kilns, and ovens for
cooking and residential heating as well as small-scale agricultural
and industrial processing. 

Often the use of traditional biomass leads
to high pollution levels, forest degradation and deforestation.

Renewable technologies with exception to traditional biomass are often termed 'modern renewables'. 
These include hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and modern biofuel production (including modern forms of waste-to-biomass conversion).

*Immersed Boundary method*
The immersed boudnary method involves embedding *singularities* around the moving body surface.
These singularities force the flow velocity to the required body surface velcocity as was done in bai et al.
The CFD-BEM approach is a simlier variant of the immersed boundary method, where a line 
of singularities is laid along the span of the blade. The strength of these singularities is determined b the required 
\(C_L\) \& \(C_D\)  from the BEM method. 
  + variant [c]
? what is singularity?
- singularity :: (mathematics) a point at which a given mathematical object is not defined
or a point of an exceptioinal set where it fails to be well-behavaved

why cavitaton is related with *Dynamic pressure*

When and where does cavitation happen?
Cavitation can occur *near the fast moving blades of the turbine* where local dynamic head increases due to action of blades which causes static pressure to fall. 
- Cavitation also occurs *at the exit of the turbine* as the liquid has lost major part of its pressure heads and any increase in dynamic head will lead to fall in static pressure causing Cavitation

*  duties of editor and reviewer



This statement explains ethical behaviour of all parties 
involved in the act of publishing an article for journal, 
i.e.: the author, the Managing Editor, Associate Editor, Advisor, the reviewer and the publisher. 
This statement is based on internationally accepted Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors.

DUTIES OF EDITORS:

In addition to many general duties, such as constantly improving the quality and integrity of the journal, striving to needs of authors and readers, encouraging academic research, and others, the editors accept obligation to apply best will and practice to cope with the following responsibilities:

Editorial Board

Editorial board will be generated from recognized experts in the field. The editor will provide full names and affiliations of the members as well as updated contact information for the editorial office on the journal webpage. Editors are the sole responsible persons for the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, it may be subjected to peer review but the final decision is bound to the concerned editor. Any decision taken or matter of concern about a submitted article should not be revealed to anyone by an editor. If one of the editor is willing to publish an article the article should be processed by another editor.Editor should refrain from using the information, data, theories, or interpretations of any submitted manuscript in her/his own work until that manuscript is in press

Publication decisions

The editor should be responsible for deciding which of the articles submitted to the journal should be published. The validation of the work in question and its importance to researchers and readers must always drive such decisions. The editor may be guided by the policies of the journal’s editorial board and constrained by such legal requirements, copyright infringement and plagiarism. The editor may confer with other editors or reviewers in making this decision.

Peer review process

All of a journal’s content should be subjected to peer-review. Articles submitted for possible publication are subjected to a double-blind, peer review process. Articles are first reviewed by editors. The editor may reject it out of hand either because it is not dealing with the subject matter for that journal or because it is manifestly of a low quality so that it cannot be considered at all. Articles that are found original and suitable for review are then sent to two experts in the field of the paper. Referees of a paper are unknown to each other. Referees are asked to classify the paper as accept, reject or request revisions for the submitted paper/article. Referees’ evaluations usually include an explicit recommendation of what to do with the manuscript. Referees’ comments are then seen by the author.

Editors should be ready to justify any important deviation from the described process. Editors should not reverse decisions on publication unless serious problems are identified.

Editors should publish guidance to either authors and reviewers on everything that is expected of them. This guidance should be regularly updated and will refer or link this code.

Fair play

Editor should evaluate manuscripts for their intellectual content without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors. Editors´ decision to accept or reject a paper for publication should be based only on the paper´s  importance, originality and clarity, and the study´s relevance to the aim of journal.

Confidentiality

Editor and any editorial staff must not disclose any information about a submitted manuscript to anyone other than the corresponding author, reviewers, potential reviewers, other editorial advisers, and the publisher. Editors will ensure that material submitted remains confidential while under review.

Disclosure and conflicts of interest

Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in an editor’s own research without the express written consent of the author. Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for personal advantage. Editors should recuse themselves (i.e. should ask a co-editor, associate editor or other member of the editorial board instead to review and consider) from considering manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or (possibly) institutions connected to the papers. Editors should require all contributors to disclose relevant competing interests and publish corrections if competing interests are revealed after publication.

Procedures for dealing with unethical behaviour – Unethical behaviour may be identified and brought to the attention of the editor and publisher at any time, by anyone. Whoever informs the editor or publisher of such conduct should provide sufficient information and evidence in order for an investigation to be initiated. All allegations should be taken seriously and treated in the same way, until a successful decision or conclusion is reached. Every reported act of unethical publishing behavior must be looked into, even if it is discovered years after publication.

The editor should take reasonably responsive measures when ethical complaints have been presented concerning a submitted manuscript or published paper, in conjunction with the publisher. Such measures will generally include contacting the author of the manuscript or paper and giving due consideration of the respective complaint or claims made, but may also include further communications to the relevant institutions and research bodies, depending on the misconduct seriousness.

Minor misconduct might be dealt with without the need to consult more widely. In any event, the author should be given the opportunity to respond to any allegations.

Serious misconduct might require application of one or more following measures:

    Informing or educating the author or reviewer where there appears to be a misunderstanding or misapplication of acceptable standards.
    Publication of a formal notice detailing the misconduct.
    A formal letter to the head of the author’s or reviewer’s department or funding agency.
    Formal retraction or withdrawal of a publication from the journal, in conjunction with informing the head of the author or reviewer’s department
    Imposition of a formal embargo on contributions from an individual for a defined period.

DUTIES OF REVIEWERS:

Reviewer should review and send the review comments in due time period. If the article is not in your area of interest then revert back to editor so that the other reviewers can be approached.

Contribution of Reviewer
Reviewers are the main members contributing for the benefit of the journal being a peer reviewed journal they are insisted not to disclose their identity in any form. Peer reviewer assists the Executive Managing Editor and the editorial board in making editorial decisions while editorial communications with the author may also assist the author in improving the paper. A reviewer should immediately decline to review an article submitted if he/she feels that the article is technically unqualified or if the timely review cannot be done by him/her or if the article has a conflict of interest. All submissions should be treated as confidential, editorial approval might be given for any outside persons advice received. No reviewer should pass on the article submitted to him/her for review to another reviewer in his own concern, it should be declined immediately.

Reviewers being the base of the whole quality process should ensure that the articles published should be of high quality and original work. He may inform the editor if he finds the article submitted to him for review is under consideration in any other publication to his/her knowledge.

What should be checked while reviewing an article?

There are no hard and fast rules to analyse an article, this can be done on case to case basis considering the worthiness, quality, and originality of the article submitted. In general cases the following may be checked in a review

    Structure of the article submitted and its relevance to author guidelines
    Purpose and Objective of the article
    Method of using transitions in the article
    Introduction given and the conclusion/ suggestions provided
    References provided  to substantiate the content
    Grammar, punctuation and spelling
    Plagiarism issues
    Suitability of the article to the need
    Any conflict of interest that may be detected
    Knowledge addition to the scientific community
    Author(s) involvement in preparing the article and their interest shown towards scientific development.

A reviewer’s comment decides the acceptance or rejection of an article and they are one major element in a peer review process. All our reviewers are requested to go through the articles submitted to them for review in detail and give the review comments without any bias which will increase the quality of our journals.

Contribution to editorial decisions

Peer review assists the editor in making editorial decisions and through the editorial communications with the author may also assist the author in improving the paper. Peer review is an essential component of formal scholarly communication. Authors who wish to contribute to publications have an obligation to do a fair share of reviewing.

Promptness
Any selected referee who feels unqualified to review the research reported in a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should notify the editor and excuse himself from the review process.

Confidentiality
Any manuscripts received for review must be treated as confidential documents. They must not be shown to or discussed with others except as authorized by the editor.

Standards of objectivity

Reviews should be conducted objectively. Personal criticism of the author is inappropriate. Referees should express their views clearly with supporting arguments.

Acknowledgement of sources

Reviewers should identify relevant published work that has not been cited by the authors. Any statement that an observation, derivation, or argument had been previously reported should be accompanied by the relevant citation. A reviewer should also call to the editor’s attention any substantial similarity or overlap between the manuscript under consideration and any other published paper of which they have personal knowledge.

Disclosure and conflict of interest

Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in a reviewer´s own research without the written consent of the author. Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for personal advantage. Reviewers should not consider manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or institutions connected to the papers.
* How to select a PhD supervisor
- Where are his graduate students going?
  + 学生的去向就是你未来的去向

- 除非你有很强的独立科研能力，否则决定你未来学术道路的最主要因素，就是导师和他的研究方向

- 自己闷头做科研是不行的，必须要在有了一定成果之后，多出去开会，然后在会上多找人勾搭和混脸熟

- 在外面开会或者访问的时候，讲ppt是一件非常重要的事，一定要讲得能让别人听懂而不觉得乏味和迷失

- 现在领域已经很成熟，其实做不出来惊天动地的工作。所以大家就只能靠出去推销来提高自己工作的知名度，这样才有别人follow你或者引用你，也才能促进领域内的沟通和合作。这样你才能被别人了解，也才能帮助你找博士后和教职

- 赶热点几乎是所有年轻教授的常识。往funding多的、和实验更相关的、和quantum computing机器学习等热点交叉的方向靠拢是领域内的常态

- 去差的学校可能会有很多糟心的事情或者没法继续做科研，有了伴侣之后并不是哪个城市都方便安家

- 自己碰到按老板指的路做不下去的时候一定要多和老板交流，讨论，一起想新办法

- 读博士只是科研的开始

1柯大侠凭借自己的物理直觉从自己建立的物理模型中实验验证得到了唯一决定惯性子区间湍涡统计结构的物理因子-湍能耗散率,。2从此出发，用量纲分析法得到小尺度湍涡结构函数的2/3 定律(即在特定条件下，在湍流中，距离为r的两点的速度差的平方平均与r2/3成正比)3以及一维湍谱或标量场湍谱的,5/3定律。这三个成果统称为K氏(柯氏)理论，

* meshing wind turbine using Turbogrid
Geo: solidworks
Mesh: Turbogrid

Typically 
Features of wind turbine blades 
- highly twisted 
- no  shroud. 

So this cannot be meshed in TurboGrid.

1) The best option is to use ICEM CFD Hexa to generate a grid for such blades.
2) One way to overcome this is to split the blade near the tip, so that you put an artificial shroud. 
This can then be mesh in TurboGrid. 
As for the tip section you can generate a mesh in ICEM CFD Hexa or tetra and use *ggi*'s to connect the two meshes in CFX Pre.

*Limits*

the shroud must be defined near the tip of blade 
but in the wind turbine study we need a region between tip and shroud for this we cannot use turbogrid

1) GGI option for shroud can be used and has been used by ppl to simulate wind turbines using turbo-grid meshing.
2)  For Blade Profile definition you just need the *co-ordinates*. i. e. 
If you want to rotate a blade about x. axis, define the airfoils in X-Y planes and vary Z co-ordinate. 
I myself have done this and my blade was twisted as well.
3) Cartesian co-ordinates are enough, no need to enter cylindrical co-ordinates.

** bug
Failed to generate the export data
Context:ansfclientbmexportpts::excute exportpoints2

Answer:
I have attached a modified wb project, so that export points work.

I have changed the following:

1. move the shroud line down to the *tip* of the blade
2. extract *blade surface* as concept surfaces
3. modified the *layers* so that profile 3 intersects the corner as the blade transitions

Please note even though export point works, I think TurboGrid will struggle to mesh this blade. 
I would suggest using ICEM to generate a hex mesh for this case.

** Multiple reference frame model (MRF)
At the interfaces between cell zones, a local reference
frame transformation is performed to enable flow variables in one zone to be used to calculate fluxes
at the boundary of the adjacent zone. The MRF *interface formulation* will be discussed in more detail
in The MRF Interface Formulation (p. 24).

*** Goal: check one rotor, rear turbine
How?
1. check the resulting force (R) on blade, tangential force should be in the same direction as rotating direction
2. check velocity at outlet, turbine extracts kinetic energy from water, the outlet velocity should be smaller than inlet free stream velocity.

make sure Cp is positive when TSR < 6

Clarke (Clarke et al., 2007) designed a contra-rotating tidal current turbine 
using the modified BEMT and conducted the model tests in a towing tank. 
The testing results demonstrated that a contra-rotating turbine 
with near-zero reactive torque on the support structure, 
near-zero swirl in the wake, and 
high relative inter-rotor rotational speeds can operate successfully.

The

Roadmap:

goal, methods, results, implication
In this study, CFD RANS is used to simulate a counter-rotating dual-rotor MCT proposed in the previous study.
The CFD results of performance, thrust coefficents and mean wake axial velocity are compared with
that of the BEM coupled with Park wake model.
# Evaluating BEM
For a single-rotor MCT, small discrepancies are observed for front rotor,
 and larger discrepancies for rear rotor when comparing the CFD and BEM results.


observe = examine = recognize= discover

  # wake
The mean axial wake veloicty agrees better with the high turbulence intensity (TI), rather than  a low TI.

# dual-rotor
 CFD results shows that 
The performance （Cp) of rear rotor depends on the ambient turbulence intensity. The maximum Cp of dual-rotor turbine
 is 4\% higher than that of the original e387 single rotor turbine. Fluid visualization from the CFD provides more details of the flow condions and vortex
behind rotors.
This numerical simulation give more credibility to the BEM Park model.

% counter rotating turbine  in wind/tidal turbine
although little research on dual-rotor tidal turbine, numerious studies have been conducted on the counter rotating wind turbine (CRWT).
However, the reader need to keep in mind that both rotors are pitched in the same direction for the CRWT.
# Methods, actuator disc model, BEM+wake models, exp
Newman did early theorical study on the CRWT based on actuator disc theory.
Later,the performance of a CRWT was evaluated by more advanced numerical methods, 
incluing the blade element momentum (BEM)theroy, actuator line model\cite{Shen2007Analysis,vaselbehagh2017wind}
free-wake vortex lattice method \cite{lee2013velocity} and CFD\cite{vaselbehagh2017wind}. The wake velocity behind the front rotor 
can be evaluated using the experimental wake data or wake models.
Several in-site experiments on CRWT prototypes \cite{jung2005aerodynamic,cho2017development,wang2018an} 
were conducted to the  validation of theorical and numerical results.
full-size experimental tests shows that the maximum power coefficient of CRWT can is close to  0.5 \cite{cho2017development}.

Parametric studies include pitch angles \cite{hwang2013optimization},
rotor spacing  \cite{Sundararaju 2017}, rotor diameter ratios \cite{jung2005aerodynamic}, 
and rotational speed control for rotors \cite{cho2017development}.

# 1. methods: historical line, exp, numerical, 

# bem, vortex lattice method
Several researches have conducted theoritical study on CRWT based on BEM theory.

Hwang, B. studied a CRWT with different rotor sizes at 0.33D rotor spacing,  
using BEM, and the configuration was optimized using the generatic algorithm.

free-wake vortex lattice method \cite{lee2013velocity}, where the wake behind the front rotor was represented using  the 
constant vorticity contour model. The max Cp of the CRWT is 12% higher than that of the single rotor WT. However, 
no experimental data of CRWT is available for the validation.
# # field experiments

The author also proposed an integrated control algorithm for the counter-rotating dual rotor/dual generator wind turbine.

# 2. results

# # max Cp

experimental test showed that the max Cp is close to 0.5 at TSR 4 \cite{cho2017development}.
# # optimal TSR 
The optimal TSR for dual rotor is lower than that of a single rotor \cite{cho2017development}.
i.e. TSR_{opt,dual}= 0.5 TSR_{opt,single}
#+begin_quote
The data shows that the system can
lower the tip speed ratio at which Cp curve attains its maximum, almost by half in comparison to the
conventional three bladed single rotor system, possibly reducing the noise caused by rotor blades.

*Velocity seen by the rear rotor*
- method 1: velocity from actuator disk model 
the rear rotor operates inside the fully developed stream tube of the front rotor

limitations: 
1. the inflow velocity on the rear rotor is excessively reduced 
2. the wake from the rear rotor does not affect the inflow on the front rotor

the velocity seen by the rear rotor is evaluated by Vortex Lattice Methods \cite{lee2013velocity}
U_{\infty,r}  = U_{\infty} (1-1.6 a_f), where the a_f is the axial induction factor of front rotor.

** Generator configurations for counter rotating wind turbines
- a. two independent generators, one for each rotor
- b. a differentidal planetary gearing coupling both rotor to a single generator
- c. one generator with kinematic coupling of two rotors ( reduce cost)

for c case, the front and rear rotors always rotate with the same shaft torque due to the kinematic coupling between the stator and the armature. As a result, the torque balance must be considered during the design process

- electric motor ::  converts electrical energy into mechanical energy

In this study, an optimization process to obtain the maximum power from a counter-rotating wind turbine is carried out 
*while* *considering* the torque balance
** email-- experimental test in your paper in 2013

Hi Hwang,

I read you paper entitled 'Optimization of a counter-rotating wind turbine using the blade element and momentum theory" published in 2013.

I have a question in figure 5 in your paper.
Is experimental data for a single rotor turbine or counter rotating rotors ? 
in other words, Do you test dual-rotor turbines experimentally?

Regards
kaiming

the structure of the counter rotating dual rotor (CRDR) system proposed in this paper is different from some
other CRDR systems reported in Refs. [12,13] where the speeds of
two rotors are independent of each other because two rotors are
not mechanically connected.

two rotors rotates with the same speed in opposite direction.

    Two generators fixed on a tower can control generation and yawing, cooperatively.


    Dual generator system can reduce the inverter size and driveline capacity by half.


    Counter rotating dual rotor can be operated at lower speed than single rotor system.


    An integrated control algorithm for CRDRDG turbine system is proposed

A free-wake *vortex lattice method* for the counter-rotating wind turbine is developed.
-  Aerodynamic characteristics are compared with a single rotor by using it. 
-  The tip vortices of both the front and rear rotors are more expanded radially.
-  The maximum power coefficient increases by 12% from that of the single rotor. 
-  The axial induction factors vary inversely each other with the rotor distance.

* VLM--vortex lattice method -
The VLM models the lifting surfaces, such as a wing, of an aircraft as in infinitely thin sheet of discrete votices to compute lift and induced drag
The influence of the thickness, viscosity and other things, is neglected.

VLMs can compute the flow around a wing with rudimentary geometrical definition. 
For a rectangular wing it is enough to know the span and chord. On the other side of the spectrum, 
they can describe the flow around a fairly complex aircraft geometry (with multiple lifting surfaces with taper, kinks, twist, camber, trailing edge control surfaces and many other geometric features).

By simulating the flow field, one can extract the pressure distribution or as in the case of the VLM, the force distribution, around the simulated body. This knowledge is then used to compute the aerodynamic coefficients and their derivatives that are important for assessing the aircraft's handling qualities in the conceptual design phase. With an initial estimate of the pressure distribution on the wing, the structural designers can start designing the load bearing parts of the wings, fin and tailplane and other lifting surfaces. Additionally, while the VLM cannot compute the viscous drag, the induced drag stemming from the production of lift can be estimated. Hence as the drag must be balanced with the thrust in the cruise configuration, the propulsion group can also get important data from the VLM simulation.

application:

- used mainly in the early stages of aircraft design
- aerodynamic education at university level

** Historical background

John DeYoung provides a background history of the VLM in the NASA Langley workshop documentation SP-405[1].

The VLM is the extension of Prandtl lifting line theory [2], 
where the wing of an aircraft is modeled as a Horseshoe vortex. 
The name was coined by V.M. Falkner in his Aeronautical Research Council paper of 1946[3]. The method has since then been developed and refined further by W.P. Jones, H. Schlichting, G.N. Ward and others.

Although the computations needed can be carried out by hand, the VLM benefited from the advent of computers for the large amounts of computations that are required.

Instead of only one horseshoe vortex per wing, as in the lifting line theory, the VLM utilizes a lattice of horseshoe vortices, as described by Falkner in his first paper on this subject in 1943.[4] The number of vortices used vary with the required pressure distribution resolution, and with required accuracy in the computed aerodynamic coefficients. A typical number of vortices would be around 100 for an entire aircraft wing; an Aeronautical Research Council report by Falkner published in 1949 mentions the use of an "84-vortex lattice before the standardisation of the 126-lattice" (p.4).[5]

The method is comprehensibly described in all major aerodynamic textbooks, such as Katz & Plotkin[6], Anderson[7], Bertin & Smith[8] or Houghton & Carpenter[9]
Theory

The vortex lattice methods is built on the theory of ideal flow, also known as Potential flow. Ideal flow is a simplification of the real flow experienced in nature, however for many engineering applications this simplified representation has all of the properties that are important from the engineering point of view. This method neglects all viscous effects. Turbulence, dissipation and boundary layers are not resolved at all. However, lift induced drag can be assessed and, taking special care, some stall phenomena can be modelled.
Advertisements
Assumptions

The following assumptions are made regarding the problem in the vortex lattice method:

    The flow field is incompressible, inviscid and irrotational.
    The lifting surfaces are thin. The influence of thickness on aerodynamic forces are neglected
    The angle of attack is small, small angle approximation.

Method

By the above assumptions the flowfield is Conservative vector field, which means that there exists a velocity potential:
\bar{v} =\nabla \phi

and that Laplace's equation hold.

Laplace’s equation is a second order linear equation, and being so it is subject to the principle of superposition. Which means that if y1 and y2 are two solutions of the differential equation L(Y), then the linear combination c1y1 + c2y2 is also a solution for any values of the constants c1 and c2. As Anderson[7] put it "A complicated flow pattern for an irrotational, incompressible flow can be synthesized by adding together a number of elementary flows, which are also irrotational and incompressible.”. Such elementary flows are the point source, the point sink, the doublet and the vortex line, each being a solution of Laplace’s equation. These may be superposed in many ways to create the formation of line sources, vortex sheets and so on.
Aircraft Model

The lifting surfaces of an aircraft is divided into several panels. A horseshoe vortex is applied on each of these panels and the velocity vector generated by the vortices at the collocation points of each panel is computed. The vortex is placed at the 1/4 chord point of each panel, and the collocation point at 3/4 chord. For a problem with n panels, the induced velocity of each unit strength vortex on each panel is collected in the influence matrix W

\mathbf{W} = \begin{bmatrix} w_{11} & w_{12} & \cdots & w_{1n}\ w_{11} & \ddots & & \vdots \ \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots \ w_{n1} & \cdots & \cdots & w_{nn} \end{bmatrix}

A Neumann boundary condition is applied, which prescribes that the normal velocity at the boundary is zero. It is also known as the flow tangency condition, or no cross flow condition. It means that at the boundary (e.g the surface of a wing) the flow must be parallel to the surface. The following system of equations may be set up. The right hand side is formed by the freestream and the angle of attack so that b=v_{\infty} sin(\alpha).

\begin{bmatrix} w_{11} & w_{12} & \cdots & w_{1n}\ w_{21} & \ddots & & \vdots \ \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots \ w_{n1} & \cdots & \cdots & w_{nn} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \Gamma_{1} \ \Gamma_{2} \ \vdots \ \Gamma_{n} \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} b_{1} \ b_{2} \ \vdots \ b_{n} \end{bmatrix}

From this system of equations the strength Γ of the vortices can be solved for, and the forces acting on the panels be computed with

F=\rho_{air} \Gamma (V_{\infty}+V_{induced}) l

conclusion:
- γ-Reθ SST provides reliable results
the K-ω SST and Intermittency K-ω SST provide identical results, with slight changes in lift and drag values. Both the models do show a slight formation of the separation bubble, but fail to capture it. K-ω SST has been known to provide good results for external aerodynamic cases when the flow is fully turbulent.

** D' alembert's paradox - 1752
- in  theory, incompressible inviscid potential flow, *drag* is zero on a body moving with constant velocity relative to the fluid.
- in physics, drag is not zero

** correlation-- relationship between variables
correlations tell us:
- wheter this relatioship is positive or negative
- the strength of the relationship

e.g.
In the case of family income and family expenditure, it is easy to see that they both rise or fall together in the same direction. This is called a positive correlation.

In case of price and demand, change occurs in opposing directions so that increase in one is accompanied by decrease in the other. This is called a negative correlation.

We have studied the three dimensional, unsteady, flows around a wing in various flight conditions, mimicking those experienced during take-off and landing or the influence of a wind gust. With the aid of numerical simulations, as an alternative to experiments in wind tunnel, we were able to develop new wing designs that can enhance aerodynamic performance at no extra cost. These can improve an aircraft’s maneuverability, increase the amount of weight it can carry, or reduce the fuel consumed – all of which may contribute to reductions in greenhouse gases.

** Dynamic Stall of clean and fouled tidal turbine blade sections

    Supervisor: Dr. Eric Gillies & Dr. Richard Green
 (University of Glasgow)
    Sponsoring Company: Andritz Hydro Hammerfest
    PhD Student: John Walker 
The current drive to reduce dependence on finite resources and reduce emissions has increased interest in the generation of energy through clean, predictable and sustainable resources, including tidal stream power generation, which captures the kinetic energy of the ebb and flow of tidal streams. With the leading tidal stream technology demonstrators converging on a two or three bladed horizontal-axis arrangement, much of the knowledge gained through the development of wind turbines can be applied to tidal turbines. However, operation in the marine environment causes new challenges. The areas of interest for this project are dynamic lift, drag and moment loads generated by both clean rough blade sections, where the roughness is caused either by marine fouling or manufacturing roughness.

Dynamic stall is not well understood despite being a limiting factor on helicopter, wind turbine, and potentially tidal turbine performance and operational limits. The tidal turbine operating environment is one of a highly unsteady, time-varying nature with considerable shear and turbulence, complicated further by unsteady rotating effects. The occurrence of dynamic stall during normal operating conditions has the potential to dramatically reduce the turbine power output, and the potential for biofouling further complicates the issue, by effectively creating a rough aerofoil surface through the build-up of marine organisms, dependent on the turbine operation and geographical location. The majority of work to date on dynamic stall has focused on the development of helicopter rotor blades, and more recently those for wind turbine applications. Drawing on this experience and knowledge, but considering the thicker blade sections generally required for tidal turbines, the project aims to provide guidance to future tidal turbine design.

Using the dynamic stall wind tunnel test facility at the University of Glasgow, and experience from additional testing at the adjacent towing tank facilities at the University of Strathclyde, a selection of proprietary turbine blade sections will be tested.  These tests will obtain time-series load and moment data to evaluate the effect that blade thickness and roughness has on the dynamic load behaviour and stall performance.  Specific areas of research during the project will be to determine appropriate tunnel corrections for thick blade sections, and how to properly approximate marine fouling during the tunnel tests.  The validated data will be compared to existing dynamic stall/loads models and ensure that current design tools model the dynamic and roughness effects appropriately.  It is expected that a key part of the project will be an analysis of how to utilise this 2D data in 3D turbine analysis and design.

** static pressure vs dynamic pressure
The concepts of total pressure and dynamic pressure arise from Bernoulli's equation and are significant in the study of all fluid flows. (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense - they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or mercury column.) 
In incompressible fluid dynamics dynamic pressure (indicated with q, or Q, and sometimes called velocity pressure) is the quantity defined by
\[
q= 0.5 \rho u^2
\]
where q is dynamic pressure, u is flow speed
*** physical meaning of dynamic pressure
Dynamic pressure is the kinetic energy per unit volume of a fluid particle
- Dynamic pressure is in fact one of the terms of Bernoulli's equation

** ch4 surface curvature effects using RANS and BEM
There is no much difference between the E387 and A7 turbines.
The problem is that the angle of attack (AOA)considerably varies along the span. 
In order to achieve a noticeable difference, we need to have the AOA stays reasonably constant along 
much of the span and at a value above the stall of the E387 but below the A7. 

I will have a look myself how to get it, but you can also play with the BEM in terms of pitch angle and chord length.

and at a value above the stall of the E387 but below the A7. 
I will have a look myself how to get it, but you can also play with the BEM in terms of pitch angle and chord length.

Other comments:
1. You can also show P .vs. speed by fixing the RPM of the turbine as corresponding to TSR_opt.
 Hence low TSR will be high speed and result in a more noticeable difference (to the eye) between the A7 and E387.
2. It was agreed with Xiang Shen that if we use the geometry of the A7 he supplied, he will be added as a co-author. So please add him, while relate him to QM (x.shen@qmul.ac.uk)
3. Please refer to your conference paper. If you do not refer to your papers then who will?


The reason is probably the turbulent wake at those TSRs.

We are looking for a situation where A7 performs noticeably better than the E387 and still produces competitive C_P.vs.TSR. 
So for the meeting on Wed please produce:
1. C_P.vs.TSR of opt E387 and A7 on the same graph.
2. C_P.vs.TSR of original configuration with E387 and A7, but vary the pitch angle by -2 degs and 2 degs.
3. Any AOA and C_L/C_D vs x that you think may appropriate.

Results:
Optimising may cause the Cp.vs.TSR distribution to be more spiky as you got, which is not really a good thing.
 Looking at the AOA distribution, it looks okay, but optimise around AOA=10 or even 11 degrees, not 8 degrees. 
We have a decline in the AOA near the tip which is not good.
 It will also yield better difference between A7 and E387 as A7 performs better at high AOAs.


I also ran a few computation on a different configuration, see attached and got up to 10% improvement in C_P at low TSR. 
The conclusion from this short study is that the A7 has a more noticeable advantage over the E387 in C_P at off-design situation 
such as the untwisted case that I gave you last week.
You can add this short study as part of a chapter in your thesis when you talk about blade design and effect of blade section.


Following the IAENG paper that you wrote, I tried to get a configuration where the A7 turbine shows 
clear noticeable improvement over the E387 turbine, but except the untwisted case that I already email you, 
I could not get such improvement. I am not sure how Xiang managed to do it for the wind turbine,
 but it shows that *the effect of the A7 is mostly when the turbine is far from optimal configuration*.

I looked at another profile that Xiang re-designed, the NACA0012 for RE=135K, calling it QM13F (it is in his thesis).
 It is used for vertical axis turbine and not much for horizontal axis turbine. 
Nevertheless as you can see in the attached, the QM13F does yield noticeable improvement, 
although the peak C_P is obviously less than the A7 or E387.

As I already wrote *symmetric profiles* are commonly not used for horizontal axis turbines. 
However, recently we found that they can be beneficial for a *dual rotor marine turbine*.
I did not include you as co-author because I was concerned that you would have difficulties to defend it in the viva
 (CFD of it is also pretty complex). 

However, now I am more concerned that *you may not have enough accomplishments* when you get to the viva 
and thus when that paper comes back from the review process of the conference journal, I will ask to add you as a co-author.
*** Sectional 2
what is the aim to show just the e387 turbine using chord length and pitch angle optimization? This is not new unless you add the A7.
you can also add the untwisted case and the naca 
 and QM13F profile.

- n : number of blades
For n=2, optimal TSR =6.28,
For n=3, optimal TSR =4.19
With proper airfoil design, the optimal TSR values
may be approximately 25 – 30 percent above these values
- the optimal TSR for a three-bladed rotor would be in the range of 5.24 – 5.45.
*** Disadvantages of a high TSR include:
- leading edge erosion from dust and sand particles
- noise
- vibration
- Reduced rotor efficiency due to drag and tip losses
- Higher speed rotors require much larger braking systems to prevent the rotor from reaching a runaway condition

Hardy and Wright (1979, p. 7) use the symbol \( \asymp \)
 to denote that one quantity is asymptotic to another. If \(f=\phi \),

* Irrotational(potential) flow
- irrotational flow :: a flow in which each element of the moving fluid undergoes /no net rotation/ 
with respect to a chosen coordinate axes from one instant to other

- irrotational flow = potential flow

- Rotation of a fluid particle can be caused only by a torque applied by shear forces on the sides of the particle. 
- Since *shear forces* are absent in an ideal fluid, the ideal fluids is essentially irrotational
- when the flow is viscid, it also becomes rotational.
This is due to the fact that viscosity introduces velocity gradients and introduces distortion and rotation of fluid particles, 
even though the fluid as a whole need not rotate about a fixed center. 
   + viscid flow >> rotational flow ( viscosity is the reason for rotation of fluid particle)


* inviscid flow
inviscid=frictionless

- all real fluids have finite viscosity
- strictly speaking the concept of inviscid flow is applicable only to ideal flow
- non strictly speaking, the flow outside boundary layer could be approximated as inviscid flow
http://nptel.ac.in/courses/112105129/R&AC%20Web%20files/R&AC%20Lecture%206/Hyperlinks/Steady,%20inviscid%20and%20irrotational%20flow.htm

* Does irrotational imply invisid?



* harmonic functions.
- harmonic function :: Solutions to the Laplace equation
- potential theory(mathematics) :: the study of harmonic functions.


* fast convergence
- coarse mesh
- first order then second order
- inviscid model > standard k -e turbulence model, then switch to SST k -omega model

* inviscid flow in Fluent
solve Euler Equations
neglect the viscosity
** applications
1. appropriate for High Reynolds number application where inertial forces >> viscous forces
e.g. an aerodynamic analysis of some high-speed projectile
an inviscid analysis will give you a quick estimate of the primary forces acting on the body.

After the body shape has been modified to maximize the lift forces and minimize the drag forces, you can perform a viscous analysis to include the effects of the fluid viscosity and turbulent viscosity on the lift and drag forces. 
2. provide a good *initial solution* for problems involving complicated flow physics and/or complicated flow geometry. 
In a case like this, the viscous forces are important, but in the early stages of the calculation the viscous terms in the momentum equations
 will be ignored. Once the calculation has been started and the residuals are decreasing, you can turn on the viscous terms (by enabling laminar or turbulent flow) and continue the solution to convergence. For some very complicated flows, this is the only way to get the calculation started. 


* convection
convection is the heat transfer due to bulk movement
of molecules within fluid such as gases and liquids

- convection takes places through advection, diffusion or both.


* Volumetric flow rate
Q or \dot V 
unit: m^3/s
\[
Q = \dot V = \frac{\dot m}{\rho} 
= \lim\limits_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t}= \frac{\mathrm d V}{\mathrm d t}
\]

another expression
\[
Q = \mathbf v \cdot \mathbf A
\]
The above equation is only true for flat, plane cross-sections. 

In general, including *curved surfaces*, the equation becomes a [[surface integral]]:
\[
Q = \iint_A \mathbf v \cdot \mathrm d \mathbf A
\]


** uniform flow
- uniform flow is a function of time only. At a instant time, uniform flow has the same velocity at all points in the flow.(Anderson 3.9)
*** properties of uniform flow
- zero divergence
- \phi satisfies Laplace's equation
\[ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0
\]
- zero curl, irrotational, no vorticity
\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{v} =0
\]

– DEFINE_ADJUST
• Executed at the beginning of each iteration
– DEFINE_ON_DEMAND
• Executed manually
– DEFINE_EXECUTE_AT_END
• Executed at the end of an iteration or a time step

DEFINE_ON_DEMAND is executed only when the user needs it
– It is not suited for monitoring a simulation
• DEFINE_ADJUST and DEFINE_EXECUTE_AT_END are executed in each iteration
– DEFINE_ADJUST is executed at the beginning of an iteration for steady state and transient simulations
• It has access to the results of the previous iteration
– DEFINE_EXECUTE_AT_END is executed at the end of an iteration for steady state or at the end
of a time step for transient simulations
• It has access to the results of the last iteration and therefore it is the best choice for postprocessing
purposes (e.g. monitor derived quantities)
