* ref
A good C++ reference is a necessity. Here are some suggestions:

    A good reference of the language and standard library is available at http://en.cppreference.com/.
    A more tutorial-based approach is available at http://www.learncpp.com/. This spends more time teaching, rather than acting solely as a reference.
    If you like physical books, Ira Pohlâ€™s C++ Distilled is a good option.
