** k fit
if you wish to improve the manuscript 
you should also best fit the Park model to the RANS results. 

- Best fit :: it means changing k until it best fits the RANS results.

Many modern plotting software has best fit options. 
for example in =gnuplot= the following script can be used to best fit the park model:

#+begin_src 
# write the value of a which is u_inf*(1-sqrt(1-C_T))
a = .... 
#write the value of the diameter D
d = .....
f(x) = a*d*d/((d+2*k*x)*(d+2*k*x))
# res.dat is the file containing two columns of x, C_T 
fit f(x) via k
plot 'res.dat' with lines lw 1, f(x) lw 3 title "best fitted"
#+end_src 

Further information can on best fit and least square operations can be found in 'Numerical Recipes for fortran'

Hello,

I had time to read the manuscript that you sent me.

It is encouraging that you took the initiative to write this journal manuscript, but it needs a lot of work as I am afraid that in its current form it is likely to be rejected. Besides the style that needs fixing, my main concern is the claim that the CFD gives more credibility the BEM-Park model, which is not correct according to Fig 7. This may be fixed by the following steps:
1. Numerical methods:
Eqs (1) to (6) are not numerical methods but definitions. They should appear under Section 2, where you should also add the definition of C_P for the dual rotor (you can join expressions together to reduce the number of equations, e.g. the definitions of dual rotor TSRS are all in one equation separated by commas). Instead there should be a description on the BEM-Park model with an explicit expression of the velocity deficit in Park's model under numerical method. Such description appears in your PhD thesis and you can use it as it is not a journal publication. The CFD paragraph can be broken to 2-3 paragraphs and must also include a paragraph how the dual rotor configuration is modelled.
2 Grid convergence:
You should also show convergence in C_P (coefficient of power). It can be for a certain TSR.
3 Single rotor case:
What is the C_P for TI=15%? If it is much reduced, it can explain the better velocity recovery behind the rotor. You should look for a ref where they also got reduced C_P from RANS as compared to other results when the blade is mostly in stall in order to better support the reduced C_P from RANS at theta_T=-2 degs.
4 Dual rotor case:
Fig 7 is a mess. I do not understand the short lines from RANS. Are they for dual rotor where the front rotor is at theta_T=2 degs and the rear rotor is at theta_T=-2 degs? If yes, then something is very wrong with the RANS calculation, because by Fig 6a RANS gives positive C_P for the rear rotor when TSR<6. In IJET paper the front rotor's C_P line was added to the graph of the dual rotor C_P lines in order to show the benefit of using a dual rotor configuration. You can use the same approach for Fig 7 or even better and just show the lines for a dual rotor configuration. The IJET BEM-Park results are for dual rotor with the same RPM (front and rear) which means the same TSR if normalised by the free stream velocity U_infinity or the same TSR which means the TSRs of Eq (4) and (5) for the front and rear rotors respectively.
5 Park wake model evaluation:
By Fig 9(b) it seems that TI=15% case fits pretty well the Park model with k=0.04 (unlike what is written in the text). Can't we get a new k to fit the line of TI=1% and repeat the calculation of BEM-Park model? It will also be of great interest to see the radial distribution of the velocity recovery, i.e. to integrate the velocity over the azimuthal direction. That can be incorporated into the BEM model in a future calculation
6. Journal:
I saw that you used Elsevier LaTeX format. What journal do you have in mind?
7. Authors:
I saw that you added Jiahuan as a author which is fine. However, please note that SEMS regulations require a SEMS academic to be a corresponding author (there can be more than one corresponding author) particularly when SEMS has put some funding into the project, unless there is a unique reason not to.

My further specific comments are in the attached.

You can deal with all this after the viva and we can talk about it when you come here.

Regards,

Eldad

** BEM+ park wake model
what is park wake model?
mathematical expresssion?
important figure?
what problem does park wake model solve?
why use park wake model?
who address the park wake model for the first time?
How is park wake model implemented?

*Limits of the BEM-Park model:*
-  It neglects swirl in the incoming velocity seen by the rear rotor 
- it assumes that velocity is uniform (obviously it also assumes no turbulence).
-  The Park model has an empirical wake decay constant, k, that its value was taken from wind turbines. 
Is it correct for water turbines with a different Reynolds number? 
   + k is related with turbulence intensity
- It neglects the effect of the rear turbine on the front one.

** BEM Compiling

BEM results for comparing NACA0012 and QM13F HAMCT for dual turbine.

Results were already produced and are in the folders naca0012 and qm13f

*Procedure of producing results:*
1. Run BEM for front rotor and rear rotor separately. 
the *blade chord length and pitch angle* are in the files ~blade_naca0012.dat~ and ~blade_qm13f.dat~. 
The 2D hydrofoil profile data ( Cl Cd vs AOA) is in ~naca0012_1.dat~ and ~qm13f_Re_135k.dat~. 
The code is ~bem_hat.f~ and its input file is ~data.in~
2. Run ~cpdual.f90~ with the input file ~data_dual.in~ to generate ~coeff_dual.plt~ that contains the C_P and C_T for the dual turbine. 
Explanation about the input is in ~data_dual.in~

In 1983,  \textcolor{red}{Newman} \cite{newman1983actuator} did
 analytical study on dual-disc based on the linear momentum theory,
 and his analysis concluded that the maximum power coefficient could be 16/25,
 which was 8\% higher than Betz limit (16/27) .

%newman1983actuator
% what is it and how is it different from glaurt's research
% the rotors are same diameters

Both rotors were optimally pitched towards the incoming flow and two counter rotating configuration sought to reduce swirl flow losses 
that are important for the two discs are close to each other \textcolor{red}{(X/D<1)}. In Newman's model (Fig.	\ref{fig:Newman'DoubleDisk}), two same diameter discs are in tandem layout which are enclosed by  two stream tubes. The control volume is 
decomposed into two stream tubes which are independent from each other. 
The 1D linear  momentum is applied to both stream tubes  and the fluid across  discs is assumed 
to be inviscid, incompressible, and steady. 
Same velocity deficit is assumed in both stream tubes of  the front rotor, 
but the velocity induction factors are different in the far wake of rear disc.

In 1986, Newman extended his dual-disc model to multiple actuator-disc model, 
and concluded that the optimal Cp is \(8n(n+1)/[3(2n+1)^2]\) for \(n\) discs in tandem arrangement. The maximum Cp is 2/3 when \(n\) is larger than 6, which is 13\% higher than the maximum Cp of single actuator disk model\cite{newman1986multiple}. Since then, extensional works on dual or multiple rotors have been conducted by many researchers  \cite{sundararaju2017aerodynamics,oprina2016review,clarke2007design,herzog2010performance}. Newman's model has been extended by  Sundararaju et al. \cite{sundararaju2017aerodynamics}, which assumes different axial velocities in inner and outer stream tubes at the front actuator disc (	Fig.	\ref{fig:DualRotorModel}b). %\ref{SundararajuDualDisk}. 
Based on Sundararaju's model, the max Cp  for dual actuator discs is as high as 0.814 with disc spacing of 2.8D.
# rotating in the same direction
 Mycek et al. \cite{mycek2014experimentalb} did experimental tests on  two co-axial turbines in the IFREMER flume tank. The effects of two independent variables, turbulence intensity and rotor spacing, were studied. At low turbulence intensity level (3\%), the maximum power coefficient of rear rotor was only about half of the power coefficient of single rotor, while the maximum power coefficient of rear rotor could reach  roughly 80\% of the single rotor when the turbulence intensity level was high (15\%). As rotor spacing increased, the maximum power coefficient of rear rotor increased as well. The optimum \(TSR\) was as low as 2 at low rotor spacing (X<4D) and low turbulence intensity level (3\%).


In the above mentioned analysis, the rotational relations between the front and rear rotors are not specified. There are two types rotational relations, co-rotating and counter-rotating, respectively.

** Why does the velocity increase along the wake?

- the mixing of the shear layer of wake, there are velocity large gradient, du/dy is large

** total Cp of dual rotor
Eq 5 and 6 in the published paper
Where Cp, rear = P/(0.5 ρ (U- \Delta U)^3 A),  and Cp, front = P/(0.5 ρ U^3 A), and U is free stream velocity.
The Cp  calculated by BEM is relative to the wake velocity seen after the front rotor.
 If we normalise as relative to the *free stream speed* , the Cp of the rear rotor must be corrected downwards.

Clarke (Clarke et al., 2007) designed a contra-rotating tidal current turbine 
using the modified BEMT and conducted the model tests in a towing tank. 
The testing results demonstrated that a contra-rotating turbine 
with near-zero reactive torque on the support structure, 
near-zero swirl in the wake, and 
high relative inter-rotor rotational speeds can operate successfully.

wake axial velocity U_x ~ X

*Assumptions:*
- uniform axial velocity in the wake

*Derivation*
1D momentum theory

The value of k in the park model is related with turbulence intensity, and a relationship of k=0.4TI is used in this case, which is recommended by Pena \cite{pena2016application} and Goccmen \cite{goccmen2016wind}.
Park wake model, one of the earliest wake models, was proposed by Jenson [76] in 1983.
 It is widely used for the wind farm power prediction due to its simplicity,
reasonable accuracy, and easy implementation. Generally, the Park wake model is
valid for downstream distances of three rotor diameters (3D) or more [77]. A linear
expansion of wake and uniform axial velocity are assumed in the Park model. An
empirical wake expansion rate, k , is used in the calculation of induced velocity.
The recommended value of  k  is 0.04 [78] and 0.075 for offshore and land wind farms,
while these values may not suitable for marine current turbine. 
For a marine current turbine operating in a wake region, a turbulence intensity dependent
 k  was recommended by Pyakurel et al. [79].
 # k calibration and comment
A joint *Jensen/Ainslie approach* was proposed to calibrate the  k
 using the center line velocity and thrust from CFD results.
The calibrated k  values are 0.0325 (TI=3%), 0.0477 (TI=6%), and 0.0679(TI=9%)
However, this correction is less accurate because the wake shape behind an isolated
marine current turbine normally forms a Gaussian shape distribution, and the axial
mean velocity is minimum at the center line. Calibration based on area-averaged
axial mean velocity will be a better option.

* Abstract
% roadmap: goal, methods, results, implication
In this study, CFD RANS is used to simulate a counter-rotating dual-rotor MCT proposed in the previous study.
The CFD results of performance, thrust coefficents and mean wake axial velocity are compared with
that of the BEM coupled with Park wake model.
% Evaluating BEM
For a single-rotor MCT, small discrepancies are observed for front rotor,
and larger discrepancies for rear rotor when comparing the CFD and BEM results.
The mean axial wake veloicty agrees better with the high turbulence intensity (TI), rather than  a low TI.
CFD results shows that the performance （Cp) of rear rotor depends on the ambient turbulence intensity. The maximum Cp of dual-rotor turbine
is 4\% higher than that of the original e387 single rotor turbine. 
Fluid visualization from the CFD provides more details of the flow conditions 
and vortex behind rotors.
This numerical simulation give more credibility to the BEM Park model.

* Review

- blade pitching affects the Cp
- hard to find the right RMP_rear for a given TSR
RANS results of one rotor at different TSRs, and dual rotors at TSR =4.25 are attached.

-	For one rotor, the RANS and BEM matches generally.
-	For Dual, the results are Cp of front rotor only. The Cp is much large than one rotor case.

Max residual 8e-4

At TSR =4.25
One rotor, Cp =0.35
Dual rotor, X=2D, mean Cp= 0.47
Dual rotor, X=2D, mean Cp= 0.53

Also, The Cp of front Rotor at X=4D is almost steady with fluctuation within 1%
But for X=2D, more than 10% fluctuation of Cp is observed, which suggest the interaction between the front and rear rotor is strong.

Further work focus on unsteady sliding mesh modelling for dual rotor at X=2D


Luska’s blade at negative pitch is always propeller

RANS one Rotor front eldad blade match BEM very well
RANS one Rotor Untwist Blade doesn’t match BEM very well
RANS, one Rotor Rear, Eldad Blade
RANS is lower than bem 

RANS Dual Rotor untwist blade 4D:
Rear rotor is a propeller
RANS, more fluctuation of Cp for 2D than 4D case

** Blade twist angle and chord length
file:figures/ch5/pitch_twist_naca0012_ch5.png

why twist angle design is \theta = \theta _T *R/r?

to achieve Cp for high TSR


tip pitch angle, twist and chord length pitched as rosen's methods


? is it justifiable for chord length and twist angle distributions?
according to Burton's model, local pitch angle = \phi - \alpha
for a given designed TSR,D, the \phi is the same for e387 and naca0012, 
The  max Cl/Cd of e387 and naca0012 happen at AOA=8
thus the local pitch angles of e387 and naca0012 are the same
chord length at each station is based on Luska's model



Blade pitch angle is redesigned based on a method proposed by rosen

- blade profile >> naca0012

** Highlight
no pitch control

This came from the lecture notes "Wind Turbines" given by Prof Aviv Rosen of the Technion, 1987. The relevant section is attached. The solution came from Pages 6-11 and 6-12 (linear aerodynamics, drag is neglected but you can estimate the effect of the drag on C_P through Eq (6-61)).

* Conclusions
- the key is the large discrepancies between bem and CFD for Rear Rotor

- wake decay constant, k, need to be adjusted for application
