we write \( f(x)=O(g(x)) \) as \(  x \rightarrow x_o \) to indicate that the ratio \(  f(x)/g((x) \)
remains *finite* as \(  x \rightarrow x_o \). It shows that f(x) approaches its limiting value at
\( x_o \) at least as fast as \( g(x)  \) does. If \( lim f(x) / g(x) =1 \) as \( x \rightarrow x_o \). we write \( f(x) \sim g(x) \).
