* Glossary
- Boundary layer :: The region near the wall where the *viscous forces* are of the same order as the inertial forces

* Division of BL

- inner layer
  + viscous sublayer, y+ <5
  + buffer layer / blending region; (5, 60)
  + fully turbulent region/ log-law region
- outer layer

* turbulent BL equation
 drop  viscous term
Eq. 5.57-5.59 (pope,2000)











* Law of wall-- u+ = f(y+)


both internal and external flows, 
the steamwise velocity in the flow near the wall
 varies logarithmically with distance from the surface
ch7, pope
U/u_t=1/k (ln{u_ty/\nu}) + C
eq 1.20, Wilcox,3rd

* Why BL is important?
- no drag for inviscid approximation
* Boundary-layer equations
*Derivation:*
based on  the continuity, momentum, and energy equations written in a special form applicable to the flow in the BL
-  partial differential equations
