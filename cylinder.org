drag and lift force change periodically with time
- the contribution of the friction drag to the total drag forces is less than 2-3 %
- if the  blockage ratio is less than 6%, then blockage effect is negiable
** influence of Reynolds number 
for flow around a circular cylinder
Re < 40, steady symmetric
Re > 40, unsteady, asymmetric, alternative vortex shedding
** lift and drag coefficient
- T_v : vortex shedding period
- C_D : drag coefficient
- C_L : lift coefficient
\[
C_D = \frac{F_D}{\frac{1}{2} \rho D U^2}
\]
\[
C_L = \frac{F_L}{\frac{1}{2} \rho D U^2}
\]
 
* numerical  modelling of cylinder
** validation
- Parameters for validation: lift/drag coefficient, St number
