* Theories

combustion of premixed mixtures

- viability :: [u] the fact that something can be done and can be successful

- vapour :: a mass of very small drops of liquid in the air, for example steam

Combustion:

- deflagration :: the combustion process propagates outward at *subsonic* speeds
-  detonation :: the combustion process propagates outward at supersonic speeds

- mass fraction :: the fractional part of *mass*  originating from the jet (1 at jet core, and 0 at ambient region)

- mixture fraction :: (jet) normalized scalar, P161, pope

*jet types:*
1. free jet-- a jet in an infinite medium
   + negligible effect of the surrounding enclosure on its characteristics

2. confined jet
   + the surrounding enclosure significantly affects 
the jet hydrodynamic characteristics
   + confined jets are encountered in several applications, such as jet pumps, ejectors, combustors, etc.

3. injection of natural gas into a diesel engine

** entrainment

*** definition:
entrainment='nibbling' + 'engulfment' + 'induced inflow'

(FIG. 6. A caricature of turbulent jet and the entrainment., Jimmy, 2012)


*** mechanisms of entrainment

two opposite theories [fn:bing2012][fn:jimmy2012]:
1. large scale motion ('engulfment')
2. small scale turbulent mixing ('nibbling')


** Planar turbulent jet
- planar :: 2D, flow properties does not change in z direction
flow is *self-preverving* after x/d=40




** self similarity
if the scaled dependent variable, $\hat{Q}(\xi, x)$ is independent of x,
then Q(x,y) is self-similar (P99, Pope, turbulent flow)

** BCs for jet
outflow boundary condition is used for tank outlet
