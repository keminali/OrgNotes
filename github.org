** create a subfolder

You cannot create an empty folder and then add files to that folder, 
but rather creation of a folder must happen together with adding of at least a single file. 
On github you can do it this way:

    go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
    click on New file
    on the text field for the file name, first write the folder name you want to create
    then type /. This creates a folder
    you can add more folders similarly
    finally, give the new file a name, (eg. .gitkeep which is conventionally used to make git track otherwise empty folders, not a git feature though)
    finally click Commit new file.

    >> git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
#+END_SRC

Enter the project folder and add an *index.html* file:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    cd username.github.io

    echo "Hello World" > index.html
#+END_SRC

create a new repository on the command line

#+BEGIN_SRC
echo "# literature" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:keminali/literature.git
git push -u origin master
#+END_SRC
To push an existing repository from the command line

#+begin_SRC
git remote add origin git@github.com:keminali/literature.git
git push -u origin master
#+END_SRC
or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
