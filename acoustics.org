*flow-generated noise sources* could be [fn:lloyd2011modelling] ~\cite{lloyd2011modelling}:
- unsteady loading;
- trailing edge;
- vortex shedding;
- cavitation, less likely, normally can be  ignored

- For modern turbines the dominant(main) noise source is *trailing edge noise* from the outer part of the blades

* Tonal noise
- tonal noise :: /discrete frequency noise/ and is characterized by spectral tones 
that are pure tone in nature.  [fn:tonal_noise]

*How is tonal noise generated?*
Tonal noise is generated by *rotating equipment* at a predictable frequency 
relating to the rotational speed of the shaft and the number of compressor vanes, 
fan blades, engine pistons, gear teeth, etc. 

- the fundamental frequency is tonal noise is described as blade passing frequency (BPF):
        BPF = B*\omega
- \omega: blade rotational frequency (Hz)
*Tolerance levels* for tonal noise are generally at a lower threshold.

Acoustics = The scientific study of *sound*
Sound = *Pressure waves* radiating in any material medium
*** Characteristics of Sound
- compressible
- wave amplitude is very small
- Sound waves carry only a tiny fraction of the energy contained in the mean flow
    + E.g. Acoustic energy generated by Boeing 747 during take-off is not enough to boil an egg!

* Glossary

- aeroacoustics :: sound generated by aerodynamic forces or motions originating in a flow rather than by the externally applied forces or motion of classicial acoustics

- impulive :: adj, acting suddenly 
e.g.  impulsive fluctuating forces
- Bang :: a sudden loud noise caused by something 
such as a gun or an object hitting a hard surface
e.g. There was a loud bang outside the kitchen door.
- mechanism :: a method or a system for achieving something
- modulation :: (specialist) the act of changing the rate at which a sound wave or radio signal vibrates (= the frequency ) so that it is clearer
- *sound Pressure level* (SPL) (Eq.(2.3) in the reference):\\

\[
SPL=20log_{10}(p'_{rms}/P_{ref})
\]

reference pressure:
- water, P_ref=1 \mu Pa (microPascal) [fn:under-acoustics-concepts]
- air, P_ref = 20 \mu Pa

** overall sound pressure level
Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL)
The total energy contained in the spectrum is

E = √≤ S(f) df

where we integrate over all resolved frequencies.  The OASPL is

OASPL = 10 log10 (E)   [units: dB]

** power spectral density
PSD: Power Spectral Densfty

PSD is the frequency response of a random or periodic signal. 
It tells us where the average power is distributed as a function of frequency.

** blade passage frequency
BPF=B*\omega
- BPF: blade passage frequency
-B: number of blades
- \omega: blade rotational frequency (Hz)
- Blade-passing frequency (BPF) ::  the number of blades *  the rotation rate
** fundamental frequency
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency][fundamental frequency]]/, often referred to simply as the /fundamental/, 
- the fundamental (frequency) :: the *lowest frequency* of a periodic waveform
- symbol, f_o
-unit, Hz
\[ 
f_o = \frac{1}{T}
\]
- T: period

** pure tone
- Pure tones ::  wave forms that occur at a *single frequency*[fn:delfs-notes]. 
\( p(t)= p^c \cos (\omega t) + p^s sin(\omega t) \)
** tone
\( p(t)= \sum _{n=0}^\infty p^c \cos (n \omega t) + p^s sin(n \omega t) \)

** pure noise
p(t) has a continuous frequency content, the signal
is permanent, stochastic
** fundamental frequency vs Harmonics frequency

- fundamental frequency :: the *lowest frequency* of a periodic waveform. 
- 1st harmonic= fundamental frequency
Harmonics (frequency) = N* frequency

The fundamental tone (F) may also manifest itself at progressively lower intensity levels
 at integer harmonic multiples (2F, 3F, etc.).

This book[fn:acoustics_Rienstra] is inspired by the book of Dowling and Ffowcs Williams: "*sound and Sources of Sound*"\\
Categories of sound: ultrasound and infrasound

- Structural vibrationsb
- sound perception
*** Basics
Challenge in fluid dynamics:
 the equations are non-linear.This implies that an exact general solution of these equations is not available.

*** Decomposition of velocity
Under reasonably general conditions, the velocity, *v*, like any vector field, can be split into an *irrotational* and *solenoidal* part:(P.53, [fn:kac1956pm])
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}=\nabla \phi + \nabla \times \Psi , \nabla \cdot \Psi=0

* FW-H model
** TODO what problem does FWH model solve?
The Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) equation 
is essentially an *inhomogeneous* wave equation.\\

*Derivation*:
FWH equation is derived from *the continuity equation* and *the Navier-Stokes equations*\\

- Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings derived a *generalized Lighthill equation* valid for *moving surfaces*\\
** FW-H Source Calculation
1. The *spatial* and *temporal* resolution of source data directly determines
the fidelity of FW-H predictions
  -  Do we need compressible flow simulations?
  - Can we get away with incompressible source data?

2. *Unsteady RANS* or LES/DES calculation should be used
  - Unsteady RANS usually underpredicts the SPL and filters the high frequencies
  - DES can be used for *detached flows*
  - LES is used in all other cases
** FW-H Model in Fluent

refer to Chapter 15: Aerodynamically Generated Noise, theory guide, fluent.
*** The procedure for computing sound
1. time accurate flow solution for time histories of relevant variables ( \rho, v, p) on selected source surfaces
2. sound pressure signals at the user-specified receiver locations
*** application
1. *Targeted applications*
- External aerodynamic noise
- Airframe noise, landing gear, high-lift devices
- Cavity noise, sideview mirrors, wipers, antennas
- Jet noise
- Blade noise, fan noise
2. *Available for*
- 3D and 2D planar
- FW-H model not available for *axisymmetric solver*
- Rotationally periodic boundaries allowed
- Segregated and coupled implicit solvers
- FW-H model *not* available for *coupled explicit solver*


The most general Acoustic Analogy-based integral formulation today is the Ffowcs-Williams HawkingÈà•Ê™ö(FW-H) method[

FW-H model allows *Moving and Permeable surfaces*
- essentially an integral method
    + Store time-varying pressure at all points on the identified source surfaces during a transient CFD simulation
    + After transient CFD simulation is completed, an automatic Èà•Ê∏ône-clickÈà•ù routine provides sound pressure signal at predefined receiver locationsSSPM
*** Advantages
- Less computation expense
- Small CFD Domain
    + only covering source area
- Ideal for far-field applications
*** Disadvantages
- no account for backward effect of sound on flow
- no account for reflections
- Needs straight line of sight from source to receiver
*** simulation guide
**** mesh
? mesh requirement
- required only in source region
- needs to be carefully prepared
- mesh edge length= (length scale of turbulent eddies whose timescale is 1/(max frequency))/5
- wall source surfaces
   + include all walls that will experience transient pressure fluctuation
- interior source sourfaces
    + need to enclose dominant sources and important scattering sourfaces
    + quadrupole sources inside permeable source surfaces are accounted for
    + acoustic pressure field need to be resolved accurately within the region enclosed by interior source surfaces

*** Calculatoin procedure
1.  Calculate a converged flow solution. For a transient case, run the transient solution until you obtain a statistically steady-state solution as described below.
2.  Enable the FW-H acoustics model and set the associated model parameters.
3.  Specify *the source surface(s)* and choose the options associated with acquisition and saving of the source
data. For a steady-state case, specify the rotating surface zone(s) as the source surface(s).
4.  Specify the *receiver location(s)*.
5.  Continue the transient solution for a sufficiently long period of time and save the source data (transient
cases only).
6. Compute and save the sound pressure signals.
7. Postprocess the *sound pressure signals*. 

* aero-acoutics vs mechanical acoustics
Fluent acoustics is for aero-acoustics, and is different from mechanical acoustics

* sound propagation
- Sound waves propagate through *compressible media* such as air or water.\\
- Sound can propagate through *solids* as well,but there are additional modes of propagation\\
** *properties* affect the sound propagation

- *State equation* determines the *speed of sound*
  state equation:relationship between density and pressure and temperature
- The *viscosity* of the medium determines the *attenuation*. For many media,
such as air or water, attenuation due to viscosity is negligible at the
frequencies of interest.

** wave equation
- Wave equation is derived from continuity and Navier-Stokes equation
- Acoustics deals with *perturbations* traveling at the speed of sound
** acoustics classification
- *aeoracoustics*: sound generated /aerodynamically/

  + *Free-space* problem, with solid surfaces: airframe noise, fan/rotor noise, boundary layer noise, cavity noise
  + *Interior* problem: Duct noise, mufflers, ducted fan noise

* CFD Approaches to Aeroacoustics
the following methods are available and required computational resources is decreasing in order.
1. *Direct calculation-Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA)*
  - Resolve the acoustic pressure fluctuations as part of the CFD
solution
2. *Couple CFD with specialized acoustics codes, Boundary Element Methods (BEM), Hybrid zonal methods*
  - Acoustic waves are not tracked with CFD solution
  - Use special acoustics codes to calculate the wave propagation
3. *Acoustic Analogy modeling*
  - Use CFD to calculate source field
  - Use analytical solution to propagate sound from source to receiver location
4. *Steady RANS based noise source modeling*
  - Use empirical correlations to estimate acoustic radiation based on mean flow solutions
** CAA
** Couple CFD with specialized acoustics codes, Boundary Element Methods (BEM), Hybrid zonal methods
** Acoustic Analogy Modeling
- Magnitude of *acoustic* pressure fluctuations are very small compared to
*hydrodynamic* pressure fluctuations
- Acoustic radiation contains only tiny fraction of energy of the primary flow
- The classical CFD methods are not suited to cope well with the needed level of accuracy
*** Advantages of the Analogy Approach
1. Small acoustic fluctuations are separated from large hydrodynamic fluctuations
2. Separate length scales at low Mach numbers not an issue any more
  - Turbulence can possibly be calculated with even incompressible NS equations
  - Wave equation deals with long pressure waves analytically
3.  The farfield (receiver) is considered only while solving the wave equation
  - No dispersion and dissipation losses during transmission
  - Computational domain doesnÈà•Ê™õ have to include receiver
  - CFD solution only necessary in source region, allowing more accurate and less expensive simulations
  - Can focus CFD resources in source region
  - Less sensitive to BCs, NRBCs not absolutely needed
*** Limitations of acoustic analogy methods
- ignore Reflection and scattering by external (outside source region) solid surfaces 
- ignore Inhomogeneities in acoustic medium 
- DoesnÈà•Ê™õ account for _effects of sound_ on flow
- No acoustic coupling inside flow, e.g. no vortex shedding triggered by acoustics
- DoesnÈà•Ê™õ account for effect of flow on propagating sound

\]
- use isentropic relation for speed of sound
\[ p'=c^2 \rho' \]      \[ c^2 =(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho})_s
