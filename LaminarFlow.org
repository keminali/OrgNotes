- Laminar Flow :: the viscous forces are dominant (slow flow, low Re) and surficient enough
to keep all the fluid particles in line, then the flow is laminar

e.g. in a pipe with D=0.015m, the max veloicty for laminar flow is 0.07m/s

*Features*:
- smoothing streamline
- Re is low
- steady or unsteady
- Re_2000 (pipe)
- Dye does not mix with water
- Fluid particles move in straight lines
- Simple amthematical analysis possible
- Rare in practive in water systems


*types* of Laminar Flow:
  - viscous effects are important throughout the whole domain >> Ch9 Kundu
  - viscous effects are confined to the BL >> Ch10, Kundu
