* FW-H model
The Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) equation is essentially an *inhomogeneous* wave equation.\\
*Derivation*:
FWH equation is derived from *the continuity equation* and *the Navier-Stokes equations*\\
- Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings derived a *generalized Lighthill equation* valid for *moving surfaces*\\
** FW-H Source Calculation
1. The *spatial* and *temporal* resolution of source data directly determines
the fidelity of FW-H predictions
  -  Do we need compressible flow simulations?
  - Can we get away with incompressible source data?
2. *Unsteady RANS* or LES/DES calculation should be used
  - Unsteady RANS usually underpredicts the SPL and filters the high frequencies
  - DES can be used for *detached flows*
  - LES is used in all other cases
** FW-H Model in Fluent
refer to Chapter 15: Aerodynamically Generated Noise, theory guide, fluent.
1. *Targeted applications*
- External aerodynamic noise
- Airframe noise, landing gear, high-lift devices
- Cavity noise, sideview mirrors, wipers, antennas
- Jet noise
- Blade noise, fan noise
2. *Available for*
- 3D and 2D planar
- FW-H model not available for *axisymmetric solver*
- Rotationally periodic boundaries allowed
- Segregated and coupled implicit solvers
- FW-H model *not* available for *coupled explicit solver*


The most general Acoustic Analogy-based integral formulation today is the Ffowcs-Williams HawkingÈà•Ê™ö(FW-H) method[

FW-H model allows *Moving and Permeable surfaces*
- essentially an integral method
    + Store time-varying pressure at all points on the identified source surfaces during a transient CFD simulation
    + After transient CFD simulation is completed, an automatic Èà•Ê∏ône-clickÈà•ù routine provides sound pressure signal at predefined receiver locationsSSPM
*** Advantages
- Less computation expense
- Small CFD Domain
    + only covering source area
- Ideal for far-field applications
*** Disadvantages
- no account for backward effect of sound on flow
- no account for reflections
- Needs straight line of sight from source to receiver
*** simulation guide
**** mesh
? mesh requirement
- required only in source region
- needs to be carefully prepared
mesh ege length= (length scale of turbulent eddies whose timescale is 1/(max frequency))/5
- wall source surfaces
   + include all walls that will experience transient pressure fluctuation
- interior source sourfaces
    + need to enclose dominant sources and important scattering sourfaces
    + quadrupole sources inside permeable source surfaces are accounted for
    + acoustic pressure field need to be resolved accurately within the region enclosed by interior source surfaces

2.  Enable the FW-H acoustics model and set the associated model parameters.
3.  Specify *the source surface(s)* and choose the options associated with acquisition and saving of the source
data. For a steady-state case, specify the rotating surface zone(s) as the source surface(s).
4.  Specify the *receiver location(s)*.
5.  Continue the transient solution for a sufficiently long period of time and save the source data (transient
cases only).
6. Compute and save the sound pressure signals.
7. Postprocess the *sound pressure signals*.

- Accurate tracking of acoustic waves
*** Source Information
- Strength
- Contribution from different sources

- Diplole
- Quadrupole
1. Scaling valid for acoustically compact sources, l >> L
2. Monopole and dipole sources dominant at low Mach numbers
* CFD Approaches to Aeroacoustics
the following methods are available and required computational resources is decreasing in order.
1. *Direct calculation-Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA)*
  - Resolve the acoustic pressure fluctuations as part of the CFD
solution
2. *Couple CFD with specialized acoustics codes, Boundary Element Methods (BEM), Hybrid zonal methods*
  - Acoustic waves are not tracked with CFD solution
  - Use special acoustics codes to calculate the wave propagation
3. *Acoustic Analogy modeling*
  - Use CFD to calculate source field
  - Use analytical solution to propagate sound from source to receiver location
4. *Steady RANS based noise source modeling*
  - Use empirical correlations to estimate acoustic radiation based on mean flow solutions
** CAA
** Couple CFD with specialized acoustics codes, Boundary Element Methods (BEM), Hybrid zonal methods
** Acoustic Analogy Modeling
- Magnitude of *acoustic* pressure fluctuations are very small compared to
*hydrodynamic* pressure fluctuations
- Acoustic radiation contains only tiny fraction of energy of the primary flow
- The classical CFD methods are not suited to cope well with the needed level of accuracy
*** Advantages of the Analogy Approach
1. Small acoustic fluctuations are separated from large hydrodynamic fluctuations
2. Separate length scales at low Mach numbers not an issue any more
  - Turbulence can possibly be calculated with even incompressible NS equations
  - Wave equation deals with long pressure waves analytically
3.  The farfield (receiver) is considered only while solving the wave equation
  - No dispersion and dissipation losses during transmission
  - Computational domain doesnÈà•Ê™õ have to include receiver
  - CFD solution only necessary in source region, allowing more accurate and less expensive simulations
  - Can focus CFD resources in source region
  - Less sensitive to BCs, NRBCs not absolutely needed
*** Limitations of acoustic analogy methods
- ignore Reflection and scattering by external (outside source region) solid surfaces 
- ignore Inhomogeneities in acoustic medium 
- DoesnÈà•Ê™õ account for _effects of sound_ on flow
- No acoustic coupling inside flow, e.g. no vortex shedding triggered by acoustics
- DoesnÈà•Ê™õ account for effect of flow on propagating sound

** Steady RANS based noise source modeling
* Lighthill Theory
- Noise Sources are assumed in a uniform fluid at rest
- Acoustic field at observer is described by wave equation
- Acoustic and hydrodynamic fields are decoupled

*calculation steps*
1. Simulate transient flow field accurately using CFD to get the *acoustic sources*
2. Propagate noise from sources to receiver by solving *wave equation* analytically

Sound = *Pressure waves* radiating in any material medium
*** Characteristics of Sound
- compressible
- wave amplitude is very small
- Sound waves carry only a tiny fraction of the energy contained in the mean flow
